    summary: "I had a fun surf session at Swami's with decent, but not exceptional, waves and started off catching a solid one. I ran into Gregory, which made the time more enjoyable, as I usually catch a fair number of waves there. There was an incident with an overly aggressive surfer, which was disappointing; he was upset about someone dropping in on him even though it's a common occurrence at Swami's and the other surfer had signaled his intent. Overall, it was a good day, I got to see dolphins while leaving the water, and I spent my time chilling and singing acoustic melodies both in my head and out loud.",
    text: "I just surfed Swami's, got some decent waves, I wouldn't say they were like out of this world today or anything like that, but it was a fun time, I got like a solid wave to start and then saw Gregory out there and just kind of had a good time, kind of like as per usual caught like a fair number of waves for myself. And yeah, I mean there was one guy getting really aggressive out there which was kind of sad to see, I was like dude, you need to calm down, it's all good, like this is Swami's, people drop in on you, you gotta expect it, also the guy called that he was gonna go left and you were yelling at him for going left, so it's like bro, come on. But yeah, it was a good day and just like enjoying, again saw dolphins as I was getting out of the water and yeah, mostly just chilling and just singing acoustic melodies in my head and out loud the whole time."

    summary: "I just finished an exhilarating hour and a half session of surfing at Swami's, encountering a rush from catching as many waves as possible within that time frame. During the session, I managed to catch a particularly large wave—a \"bomb\"—which others struggled with but I successfully navigated, performing a decent cutback despite it being somewhat slow. Despite the physical demands of surfing, I still have plenty of energy left and feel good about the experience. While surfing brings a sense of fulfillment, I'm also preoccupied with off-shore matters like agency issues and have other thoughts that I'd like to keep to myself.",

    summary: "Yesterday, I had a great slackline session at Kate Sessions. Now, at 6:20 AM, I'm preparing to go surfing at Swabese, hoping for favorable tide conditions. Despite the really high tide and the potential difficulty of entering the water, the offshore winds could make for good surfing. Additionally, the high tide may reduce the number of people in the water, which could be a plus.",
    text: "I don't think I mentioned yesterday that I went to Slackline, and it was a solid session. I went to Kate Sessions to do that, and now it is 6.20 in the morning, and I am going to surf. Going up to Swabese, as always, and I'm going to hope that the tide is alright. It's a really, really high tide, but there's offshore winds, so hopefully it looks good. Also, probably less people, because people don't like going when the tide is really high. It's going to make getting into the water pretty tricky, though."

    summary: "I went surfing despite the high tide not being ideal, and there were around five of us in the water. One surfer amusingly brought a shortboard, which seemed unsuitable for the conditions. I realized even my own board wasn't long enough for the waves we encountered. Despite the less-than-perfect conditions, with swampy surf, I still managed to catch a few good waves.",

And one guy brought out a shortboard, which is probably the funniest thing that I've seen in a bit, for waves like that. I was like, dude, I don't even have a long enough board. So, it was funny. But, I mean, it was alright. Got a couple good ones. It was mostly just kind of swampy, swampy surf."

Note: The stoke emoji has been inferred from the textual data since it was not explicitly provided. The surf conditions, wave height, and stoke levels have been derived from the subjective descriptions given in the summaries and texts, as no specific metrics were provided. Some entries did not specify the duration of the surf session or the exact location (as in the last entry), and where this information is missing it is noted in the appropriate fields.
