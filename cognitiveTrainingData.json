Afterwards I got out of the water and I met I believe their names were Dan and Jen. Jen really liked my board, wanted to buy it. I had to say no I'm sorry you cannot buy my board but I appreciate that you like it. And they were gonna go on a bike ride, a tandem bike ride next. What a wonderful weekend that is.

I mean, it was okay, it was okay, it was okay. You know, any day that you can surf is probably a pretty decent day, let's be honest. But I got up and out of the house around 6.30, out of the house, actually out of the house around 6.15, and got to Swami's and got together. I had both my boards brought, both my boards, and I looked at the surf and it looked pretty bad. And I decided I wanted to surf still, so I went and surfed. And I decided to take out the longboard and I went leashless, which was a bad move. The surf was pretty mixed up. I got a couple decent waves, but because it was so mixed up, like really the longboard was not the board to be out there with. And eventually a big set comes through and kind of just, you know, just fucks me up, basically. I lost my board one time and then it ended up next to me and I was like, oh my gosh, I got so lucky. So then I was like, I gotta paddle out of this right now so I don't lose my board again. And then sure enough, another big wave comes through and I can't get under it. I can't hold onto my board when the wave is that big sometimes. And I lost it again. I also took a steep drop on a wave, like probably six or seven footer, and I just nosedived my board straight to the bottom of the wave. Not even straight to the bottom of the wave. I was like going the right direction, but like I just, I messed up. And I lost the board again and it was next to me again and I was like, I can't believe I'm getting this lucky. And then sure enough, I'm paddling back out and I lose the board one more time and it goes all the way into shore. And I say, you know what? I shouldn't have gone leashless today. That was lesson learned. So that was the surfing adventure for today. But yeah, there it is.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"date\": \"Jan 6, 2024 - 8:38am\",\n    \"hash\": \"f9d22c33ec1b47a21b5d2cb1916aa61c55151b3d746f8d9506d01e43e16d43d7\",\n    \"title\": \"\\\"Surfing at Swami's: A Mixed Bag of Waves, Encounters, and Harmonies\\\"\",\n    \"text\": \"I just surfed Swami's, got some decent waves, I wouldn't say they were like out of this world today or anything like that, but it was a fun time, I got like a solid wave to start and then saw Gregory out there and just kind of had a good time, kind of like as per usual caught like a fair number of waves for myself. And yeah, I mean there was one guy getting really aggressive out there which was kind of sad to see, I was like dude, you need to calm down, it's all good, like this is Swami's, people drop in on you, you gotta expect it, also the guy called that he was gonna go left and you were yelling at him for going left, so it's like bro, come on.

I looked at the cam this morning and I thought it was going to be absolutely garbage, but I decided to go anyway. I woke up at 5.30, out of bed at 5.37, and started making moves. I was watching the cam, seeing if it was worth it, drove my ass up, got there, looked at the waves, and immediately upon looking at it, you're like, gotta get out there as fast as possible. It looked amazing. It just looked great. I did. I got out there. First wave was me just messing around, feeling it out. Second wave, or third wave, probably the best wave I had today, maybe. Maybe the second best wave. I don't even know. It was a great wave, though. Just cruising through the section, going to the bottom, hitting the top, going to the bottom, hitting the top. Just cruising down the wave and having a good time, big section, kind of closing it out in front of me, barely making it through the section, continuing to ride the wave all the way to the inside, and then paddling my ass back as fast as possible back to the outside. Just so many waves today, and it slowed down towards the end, but then it really, really picked up the last 10 minutes. Some 8, 10-foot bombs came through. I'd say probably closer to the size of 7 or 8, but it was large and in charge. I got one of them for the left, and it was fucking wild. Got a couple lefts, and it was solid, but yeah, just a really fantastic day. Good size, good power. I didn't bring the leash out because I saw the waves, and I was like, you know what? I could go leashless, but this is a bad day to do it. If it's a 4-foot day, probably good. It's like 5, 6-foot day, I would say, at least for most of the waves that I was catching. Probably 5, more like 5, but because those bigger waves come through, you just never know what you're going to get, and if you get stuck on the inside, you're fucked. Also, for me, having the leash is letting me get very aggressive in terms of dropping into waves and just getting comfortable dropping into big waves that I didn't think I could drop into. That is also really great, but yeah, what a way to get the morning started. It's like 2 and a half hours out there, maybe not quite 2 and a half, like 2 hours and 15, but did that without even thinking, and my body barely even started to hurt with all the paddling, which is also sweet, just feeling solid out there. I need to hit Chandler up and see if he wants to—actually, I already hit him up—and see if he wants to freaking go out with me tomorrow, because it's going to be 6 to 8, bro. I'm bringing my longboard, 6 to 8. If it's anything like today, it's going to be fantastic. Dude, I'm just going to bring my longboard, fucking show up at his house, drop the longboard if I have to, and just keep cruising, go to Irvine or some shit after that, because shit was amazing.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"date\": \"Dec 19, 2023 - 1:07pm\",\n    \"hash\": \"7fb9eab502c35d7084cf716980233b85dbfb92e307ad09b034f3efc717c67d3a\",\n    \"title\": \"\\\"Surfing at Swamys: A Fantastic Morning Experience\\\"\",\n    \"text\": \"I also surfed this morning at Swamys.

I had a blast, and I'll go try to check the cams now, actually, to see if I can find myself for my last wave, but yeah, I don't know. Just a really great time out there. I'm really excited to go out tomorrow. I want to get out even earlier than I did this morning from my house. I think I left at 6.05 and got there at 6.25. I got out of the water around 8.49, I think, so a solid two-hour surf and a lot of waves, and I met this European guy. Fuck, what's his name? Not George, but whatever. I'll get his name again next time, but yeah, it was great out there. I can't wait to go tomorrow, get an earlier start, probably leave my house at 5.30 at the latest, really. It's probably going to be the way to go. Get that extra 30 minutes in the dark before sunrise, and hopefully with a lot less people out there, too, and catch some solid waves while I can.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"date\": \"Jan 10, 2024 - 6:21am\",\n    \"hash\": \"11789e2d600399d2c92e9b0b798dd5e9617f5d551a18a13ecec7c19a5183dd34\",\n    \"title\": \"\\\"Early Morning Surfing Adventure\\\"\",\n    \"text\": \"I don't think I mentioned yesterday that I went to Slackline, and it was a solid session.

It's a really, really high tide, but there's offshore winds, so hopefully it looks good. Also, probably less people, because people don't like going when the tide is really high.
