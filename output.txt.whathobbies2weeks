    summary: "I seek the company of people who are deeply passionate about their interests, whether it's computing, surfing, or climbing. To me, it's important to be excited about all aspects of my life and associate with those who share this intense enthusiasm. Amidst my schedule, I'm looking forward to finding a moment for leisure activities like climbing or slacklining, and to use the weekend for contemplation and strategizing my path forward. The prospect of tomorrow brings a sense of promise, hinting at the potential for new beginnings and the excitement of storytelling.",
    text: "I'm always looking to be around more smart and interesting people who really care about what they do and are not just going through the motions all the time. Yeah, I guess being in computing is like a passion and I want to be around people who are passionate about it. I think the same goes for many of the things that I'm into, surfing or climbing. I want to be around those passionate people in those sports, the people who are psyched about it because I also want to be psyched about it. I don't want to just be like, oh yeah, it's okay. I just do that thing. No, I want to be stoked and yeah, I want to be stoked about like every aspect of my life. So I do want to surround myself with more of those stoked people and yeah, just in every aspect of life. And I can't wait to hopefully have a moment of a breather at least for a little bit tomorrow and maybe go climb or slackline or something and look forward to the weekend where I can maybe take a breather as well and still have plenty of time to think and do a bit of a reset and figure out where I'm at and how I want to move forward and evaluate what I have. And yeah, I don't know if I'll have demo, quote unquote, tomorrow, but I'm feeling the promise right now and feeling the promise may be enough to begin to tell a story and that's exciting. So maybe there is some potential."

    title: "\"AI for Friendship: Building Community and Creativity\"",
    summary: "AI for Friendship is gaining interest, fueling a creative desire to establish an environment akin to an art studio filled with engaging items. Dave proposed a concept, \"14 days of 13 bad posts,\" to clear out unproductive thoughts, highlighting the importance of community building as seen in Seth Godin's work and the importance of presentation. The tool in question has the potential to be profitable, with the expectation that successful users will share their strategies, thereby encouraging more effective use by others. An idea for a social game revolves around the concept of mutual discovery between participants, with the flexibility for users to engage with the system simply or contribute to its development.",
    text: "Reviewing some of the notes from my conversation with Kristen and Dave earlier, it sounds like AI for Friendship is resonating and that there's a creative scene wanting to emerge, which is super cool. And building something like an art studio with toys in it, all of this kind of thing, makes tons of sense. A lot of the relational stuff that we've been working on. One of the things that I really liked that Dave said, it was like 14 days of 13 bad posts. Just an idea he had and kind of want to try it because it sounds like a good way to flush some crappy thinking out in some way. But also, it's just interesting as a concept. And yeah, I guess that Dave also, I believe, pointing out some of the Seth Godin work with him building communities and how people want to be part of it and that kind of thing, as well as just like packaging is important. I'm learning that I want to lean into nerds. One of the things that I said that I think is important is that if this tool is successful, someone will make really good money off of it and that person will share how they did it and that will get other people using it effectively. And the final kind of thing that I'm really, really curious about is making a social game where success is really simple. This is something that Dave suggested and the thing that immediately came to mind was we are coming together because we want to discover something about someone else and ourselves. And that's kind of the container and maybe being able to share it at the end of whatever period of time it is. And I guess going along with that is playing with this system, trying to break it. You can show up and just use it and that's about all it takes. Or you could try to build something on top of it or contribute to the core code base or whatever it is."

    summary: "The speaker is contemplating revisiting their previous TRIPS project, considering the innovative idea of transforming extensive data on Japan into an interactive web experience or ‘brain thing’, which would serve as a digital album. They express a desire to work with an individual named Chandler to utilize their collected photographs, stories, and voice notes from Japan to create a website powered by natural language queries. Additionally, the speaker reflects on the potential resurgence of web rings as a means to foster unique internet communities that appreciate diversity, suggesting these could be structured through natural language. The speaker believes that these ideas, including the reincorporation of web rings and the Japan project, form a coherent vision that can be communicated to others, and they plan to record these thoughts for future reference.",
    text: "Another aspect of this is me just basically rethinking about the TRIPS project that I had in the past. And one thing that I'm very keen on to experiment with is, well, to figure out how to get all of the data that I have on Japan into a web page or a brain thing and basically use that as the album. That is the media artifact. And right now, maybe that is its own separate thing. But overall, eventually, that should be part of the same network. But we can experiment with it in a little form. And basically, I would love to work with Chandler to take our Japan photos, our Japan stories, and our Japan voice notes and see what little website we can build out of that just through natural language queries. I feel like that would be quite fascinating in a lot of aspects. So these are the main three things that I'm talking about. And the other one was, I mean, I mentioned it in the first note that I recorded. But again, web rings. I think web rings are basically ripe. There is a certain kind of hunger for it. And a getting away from the global village and being like, OK, well, how do we form communities in a different kind of way? How do we create internet spaces very easily? And internet spaces that are diverse, that show our diversity. And I do believe that possibly that can be done just straight up through natural language. And in some sense, these things that I said form, I believe, a coherent enough vision for someone else to understand. So that is a possibility. I'm going to note it down here. But I believe that some of these notes maybe at least push in a more concrete direction."

Additionally, they noted the need to finish making a sweatshirt for someone else and pondered making adjustments to the design.",
    text: "Oh, one cool thing that happened this past weekend that I was very, very excited about. And when it happened, I was actually quite nervous that it happened, but someone complimented my sweatshirt and I am so stoked about that because I made it and I told them that I made it and this was also in front of a bunch of other people and everyone there was like, what the fuck? You made that? And I was like, yeah, I made that and people ask questions and stuff and oh, I don't know. It just made me really happy to get a compliment on my own work, you know, like making something with my own hands and then getting a compliment for it. Not something that I bought from a store. I mean, I did buy the pattern, but at the end of the day, I put it together and yeah, I don't know. It just makes me really happy that that happened and yeah, it makes me want to make some sweatshirts and maybe sell them at like highlighting events and shit, you know, like I can do that if I feel like it. So yeah, and it also reminds me, I do need to finish Chandler's too. I think I need to make him a medium though, so I'll have to, I'll have to get that going pretty soon and I may want to redo the hood and everything. So we'll have to see about that as well, but yeah, I need to finish that up and maybe that'll be something I can work on maybe this evening even. We'll see if I'm like drawn to reading or something else, but I feel like that might be a reasonable thing to try to work on. It's going to be a lot of taping if I want to do a medium for him. I think that's probably the right way to go. So yeah."

    title: "\"Embracing Flexibility: The Future of Technology Integration\"",
    summary: "The speaker acknowledges that the ideal form factor for integrating technology into our daily lives is yet to be discovered, with current attempts being preliminary. They express a desire to build the underlying infrastructure that allows various input methods to interface with personal data effectively, likening it to the function of IO devices in computers but extended to human bodies and senses. Recognizing the inevitability of change in technology, they prefer not to commit to a single form factor, instead aiming to create a flexible space that supports a wide array of experiments and inputs. Their vision is to foster an environment that accommodates continuous innovation and supports everyone, without being limited by current design paradigms.",
    text: "The next bit of writing has to do with, I don't think we have found a form factor yet for how this is going to operate in someone's life. I think Avi and Tab and the Humane thing and all of this is our first ditch attempt at making a system like this. But what I think is, well, I want to build the underlying infrastructure that makes those things possible. At the end of the day, those things are input methods. And I want to be able to support a broad range of input methods and hopefully in a very relatively small API space. The kernel for your personal data. And just like we have IO devices and things like that in computers, now this is extending it to our bodies and our senses. And I think that that definitely will need to be covered and probably can be covered quite simply. And it'll take experimentation to get there, but I think we can do it. And given that, yeah, where I want to play is, I want to support everything and everyone. I don't need to take a strong opinion on what the form factor is going to be right now, because it will change in six months. It will change in a year and a half. I would rather create the space that affords many different experiments to evolve and not get sucked into one or the other. And that is part of what I would like to create."

    title: "\"Embracing the Challenges of Developer Innovation\"",
    summary: "The speaker is excited about tomorrow but acknowledges that as a developer facing new challenges, the work is not trivial, especially given the lack of extensive documentation and the solitary nature of their current work process. They express a desire to share their learnings, possibly by writing them down, and emphasize the importance of collaboration, suggesting that \"if we do this together, it will be a better world.\" The speaker is tired of creating misleadingly impressive demos and aims to write code and interact with large language models in a more genuine and transparent way. Lastly, they recognize the complexity of building an effective agential system, admitting their current limitations while believing in its importance, and they present open questions about processing and connecting large amounts of data to better understand who we are.",
    text: "Feeling good about tomorrow. It's quite late. I guess I'm still excited in my body. And I'm getting the energy to express. And I don't know exactly what the expression is going to be yet. But one of the things that I feel recently is seeing all of these announcements and demos and things, it's for me as a developer, trying to solve some of these things definitely doesn't feel super trivial. And to be fair, I haven't been working on it very, very long. I haven't been working on it with a team of people. So maybe this is partially the issue. There's also very little documentation out there for the kinds of things that I'm experimenting with. And as Raphael said, I probably should go and basically write down my learnings. And, you know, I guess that's something that I'll write down on my questions list. So let me do that real fast. Right. So I guess the point of this message, in some way, is I'm trying to do the darn thing. And I don't want to be afraid to put out half-baked work. As in, it does actually work. It's not perfect. But I also want to have a call to action to be like, if we do this together, it will be a better world. And I don't need to hide behind doing things behind closed doors and seeing that demos may or may not be real. I've built many demos in my life. I know how easy it is to potentially impress someone with a demo. But behind the scenes, you know, it's the Homer Simpson-like meme with his back clipped together so he looks super sexy. Like, no. I'm tired of doing that. I'm tired of doing that. And I'm actively trying to write code in such a way where it is not doing that and also write calls to large language models where it's not doing that. And I'm also not perfect. Like, what I just described is an agential system. To do that correctly is an agential system. And I do not have the right understanding to build a very effective agential system right now. I don't. But I do believe that is generally the direction we are going. And that is the direction we should be going. And how do we get there? And how do we begin to process large amounts of data to put it in the right format? How do we connect data sources to each other? Those are all open and important questions to form an overall better context of who we are. And I would love to say just like shoving all the documents into RAG and pulling out the top five is going to work. But like, I just don't know how that's going to fucking work. It's just not enough context about someone. I can't fit my context in five documents unless those documents are perfect documents. And maybe through large language models we can start generating more perfect documents for them."

    title: "\"Harnessing Energy for Effective Website Development\"",
    summary: "I am feeling energetic and plan to channel this into meditation before starting work to effectively implement my ideas. It's crucial for me to detach the mental process from the technical aspect of building a website, as the conflation of both is overwhelming. Although perfection is unattainable at this stage, and low-level functionality may remain complex, this approach will facilitate the identification of components that need abstraction. Moreover, it will help distinguish between the user interface and the core system functions.",
    text: "I have so much energy coursing through my body right now. I'm going to meditate before I get into work and trying to put trying to put some of these ideas into practice with what I've written already. Not just staying out an idea land, but trying to implement them and getting base level viability out there. I think it needs to be done. I really need to be able to separate out the brain component from building a website. I think that is absolutely critical because it's driving me insane right now trying to do that already but beyond that I think it'll make it much easier for other people to use. And it won't be perfect. Some of the low-level functionality is probably going to stay within the brain for now and it's going to be kind of a pain to work with. But that'll help us discover what are the things that do need to be abstracted. And what separates user space from kernel land in some way as well."

The potential for building innovative and personalized social networks and niche communities is highlighted, with the vision of seamlessly integrating natural language and proactive notifications for enhanced social interactions. The broader implications of consolidating data suggest the potential for unlocking new social dynamics and facilitating DIY networks, adding a layer of depth to the reach and impact of social interactions. The emphasis on streamlining the process of creating and accessing these networks suggests a shift towards a more immersive and personally tailored online experience.",
    text: "One of the DCs, maybe, is that with data in all one place, it potentially becomes very, very easy to build a lot of applications. And it's almost like the limit is your imagination. And I think that this is why maybe targeting DEVs and making it very easy to do that initially is really the right way to go, basically allowing the open ecosystem to find the killer app. But one of the things that I wonder is, with the right set of protocols in place, how quickly could I build an amazing dating app? I mean, partially it is relevant in my life to some degree. And also, how quick could you build new social networks with a different paradigm? DIY social network. How can you make it easy for anyone to build a social network? I certainly would love this for different communities in my life. Facebook groups solve something. But to have it more deeply integrated, not only if you could just build things with natural language for the social network, and if it had its own page, SoCal climbers, SoCal highliners. I mean, for me, that would be sick. I would absolutely love that. And beyond that, if I could basically get that feed to me when I think about the question of, what do I want to do this weekend? And given that, it might be able to read those feeds effectively and be like, there's a Highline gathering this weekend. Maybe you want to go to that. That would be great. Or even getting a notification proactively, like, hey, by the way, someone is hosting a Highline gathering this weekend, and I notice you don't have any weekend plans yet. Maybe that's what you want to do. So anyhow, these are very basic things. But I really do believe that putting data all in one place kind of unlocks a lot of potential for social interactions beyond the self-insight stuff that it could also kind of provide. But honestly, it's almost like the social and the DIY networks that are somehow much more interesting."

So what he writes is, I really, really like this quote. And for me, in this moment, what it means is, basically, what I'm trying to do now is clarify the thinking, find the direction, the vector that I do believe in, and point myself there and be able to get there. And in clear thinking, I think probably have been doing it for years, but kind of wandering and instead of wandering is committing to a certain vector. Probably we'll have more on this later."

    summary: "The speaker is discussing their work on building infrastructure for personal AI augmented search and the various applications that can be built on top of it. They are considering the possibility of demonstrating the capability through a social network and other potential ways of showcasing its functionality. They believe they can display several demos from the same piece of code, which could be interesting and informative.",
    text: "Personal AI augmented search. Maybe that's in the realm of what I'm really doing, building infrastructure for that. And then also displaying the kinds of applications that can be built on top of it. So maybe that's a possibility. It's like I can hack together this social network and I can also do another thing. And I can do another thing. What are the ways in which are obvious to demo this? I have three or four demos just from the same piece of code, effectively. That may demonstrate something interesting."

    summary: "The speaker reflects on a podcast featuring Mark Andreessen on Rick Rubin's show, highlighting Andreessen's enthusiasm for Usenet and its decline after AOL popularized the internet. They consider the potential of small, intelligent social networks to create something meaningful, especially with a few members who have programming skills. The speaker sees the endeavor as a social game that could be enhanced by designing an experience with enough structure to engage people, yet open-ended to allow for personal contributions. Committed to this vision, the speaker expresses a willingness to work tirelessly to refactor their code base, improving it to facilitate collaboration and assist others in the effort.",
    text: "I'd also like to point out there is the Mark Andreessen and Rick Rubin podcast that I was listening to this morning. Rather, it was Mark Andreessen on Rick Rubin, Tetragrammaton, and he just mentioned early Usenet and yeah, I don't know. Again, like, we haven't networked intelligences yet. We're like speed running computing in some way, I guess. I mean, maybe yes and maybe no, right? History definitely does not repeat itself. But again, maybe it does rhyme. But anyhow, the point being, like, he basically was having great enthusiasm for Usenet, and apparently it was, like, some September where it all burned, basically, when AOL got everyone online. But I do wonder, you know, again, maybe this is the social network aspect, microsocial network is getting 100 smart people or 25 smart people into a room, and at least a few that have programming experience and be able to, yeah, do something. And I very much wonder, like, this is something that I'll have to bring up talking to Kristen and Dave tomorrow because it's a social game. It's effectively a social game. And we can design an experience or potentially, like, we give enough scaffolding to make it interesting, and then let people build on it themselves. And I will literally stay up all day and night to help people if that's what it takes. Like, I know my code base is not the best, and it needs to be refactored in some ways. There are many ways I wish to refactor it, and, like, if it takes, like, just putting the head down and doing the work to make it easier for people to do so, like, so be it, you know? Let's go."

Overall, they aim to implement a solution to streamline this task.",
    text: "I am also very, very curious, well, two things. One is summarizing the last 24 hours, basically, so I can get an idea of what I've been thinking about in the last 24 hours. So when I come the next day, back to the computer, I have a solid understanding of where I left off the day before, and I don't have to be explicitly writing. And the second part is trying to figure out some kind of social mechanism for putting this information out there. Like the things that I'm saying, like thinking how I wish to consume this information, because I would like this kind of information coming towards me. If John has one of these, again, I really would like to have that feed that is algorithmically, in some way, very related to things that I care about. And that the things that I care about, other people can get some insights in. And again, partially making that very visible up front by just what I'm saying, like putting that on a webpage. Here are the things that I'm interested in right now, and historically, what I have been interested in, based on my actions, as well as what I'm saying. And then I also would love to be able to consume that from other people, and to some degree, have it less of a show, not like trying to show off, like this is what I'm doing and what I'm thinking, but like a bit more objectively of this is what I'm thinking, and this is what I've been doing. At least in the sense, I'm having to record audio and do it. I guess I could write the same things, and yeah. But for me, I guess maybe that's just not the medium that I wish to operate in. So this is more stuff, and I'm going to have to review everything from this evening, tomorrow, which is probably going to be an immense pain, and I'm probably going to fix that problem as soon as possible, because yeah.

It's like, that's probably true to some degree. And also, I am looking very much to continue to express myself much further than what the media landscape currently affords. And I think maybe that's the big thing. It's like, I do have all of these interests, and I want to make them a little bit more visible. And I guess I would have to make a very concerned effort to do that today and basically build a brand for each thing. And maybe that's not just where I'm at. It's like, I don't want to, maybe I'm not interested in building a brand to that degree, but I am looking to connect with people who are talking and thinking about similar things and building community from that. That's like more where I'm at, and Twitter can help, because you can get connected to everyone, but filtering to actually find those people, I still think is quite difficult in the sense like, I had a great conversation with Matthew yesterday, and that came through a friend, basically. That came through my mutual connection with John, and yeah, I mean, he's one of those connector people, but also there's got to be some better ways of doing that and also expressing yourself. And I think he is also on the same train of that in some way of like, how do I put that out there further? Yeah, I want it to be a little bit more second nature for me. I'm willing to express a lot of the things that I do, at least put them out there, yeah."

    text: "It's so interesting to me how my mood changes as a result of how my code is working. If my code is not working very well, my internal state gets very depressed and I think I don't know what I'm talking about. And oftentimes that is the case. But when the code is showing promise and is at least working to some degree, it is remarkable the improvement in my mood, how excited I am, how the ideas begin to flow when things are working. And I guess it's needing to push through the pit of despair where you find that things are not working and just to keep going against it and keep finding the breakthroughs and hitting the wall and finding the breakthrough. And one lesson for myself from this is reaching out to someone who has a bit more domain expertise is really remarkably helpful. It's amazing how just having a conversation with someone else who has some knowledge makes things move faster. And I really do wish to surround myself with people who know more about AI than I do. I don't know anything. I legitimately don't know anything. Effectively, I'm like an okay prompt engineer and I've read some papers. But do I really understand the foundations of machine learning? No. I have a kind of conceptual understanding, but I really wish to develop that much more. I really, really do. It is fascinating to me. And I am also curious to probably implement my own transformer models and try to understand how they fundamentally work. And so when I read a paper, I know what it means when they're doing certain things. So I can understand the mixture of experts, architecture at a fairly deep level. And maybe this understanding is for not, but I'm still curious about it. And boy, yeah, like I said, just what an amazing lesson to learn. What an incredible lesson to learn to just go talk to someone. And it's so much easier to talk to someone who knows what you're talking about and can at least offer something like being dumber. Being dumber is amazing. I love being dumber because the other person can just say something that makes so much more sense. And as a result, I can learn from that. And I learned through experience by bashing my head into a fucking wall for like days. And what did I learn out of that experience? I learned two great things that I should talk to people. Well, really, actually, it's just that that I should talk to people and I guess be around more of those people if possible."

    summary: "Data is fundamental to the thesis, holding immense value which is amplified when connections between datasets are improved. The inherent worth of data, particularly when effectively interconnected, should be apparent to investors, and those who don't recognize it may not be suited for investment in this area. The company's mission is to facilitate the easy linkage of data, unleashing significant value for individuals and communities. Furthermore, the future likely holds a variety of new social media platforms created by individual communities, enabled by deeper connected information, though the specific nature of these developments remains uncertain.",
    text: "Part of the thesis is around data, right? Actually, data is core to the thesis. And one thing about it I want to note down is it should be obvious to an investor that data is extremely valuable. And beyond that, if we had better connections between our data, that only makes the data even more valuable. This should not be something that needs to be explained, in my opinion. I think it is obvious. And if you do not see it as obvious, you probably should not be investing. I think this is an obvious thing to see. And by unlocking it, you should understand inherently that it is extraordinarily valuable. And our quest as a company is to make the connections between data as easy to use as possible. That is the quest. Because if we can unlock that, we can unlock an extraordinary amount of value for ourselves as people, as well as our communities. And that is what we are trying to do. I want to see much greater expression in the world. Expression not contained to existing social media platforms. And I believe it will be very, very, very possible for many social media platforms to exist. They are effectively media formats right now. But are they the only media formats that work? Absolutely not. I suspect that individual communities will come up with new ways of creating media formats for their community. It's hard to understand what that even means right now. But with much deeper connected information, I think it will become very obvious. This is just my intuition. But I feel like it must be the case. I cannot see how it is not the case. What that will look like again is completely unknown. We're not there yet."

    title: "\"Reflections on a Day of Surfing\"",
    summary: "The speaker reflects on the experience of surfing today, expressing a desire for technology to automatically provide contextual details like location and surf conditions. They describe the struggle of choosing a surf spot due to large swells, ultimately opting for a break called TORMO. However, upon entering the water, they realize the waves appear smaller than expected and the paddling distance is challenging. Despite the current pulling them southward, they persevere in their surfing experience.\n\nSure, whether it's an entire book or a brief article, I'm happy to condense it down to its core message. Just share the text with me, and I'll summarize it in 4 sentences or fewer.\n\nThe speaker recalls catching a wave and feeling elated as they successfully performed maneuvers similar to those on a long board. They caught one more wave but were tired from paddling out, which was intensified by the increasing number of inexperienced surfers. The speaker felt nervous for the less skilled surfers' safety and questioned their own abilities initially but gained confidence after catching multiple waves successfully. Overall, the speaker reflects on the enjoyment of the day's surfing experience.",
    text: "It is interesting being out in the water, surfing today, and just having an absolute incredible wave. You know, it would be nice if the computer knew the context of the surf automatically. In the sense, like, it knows that when I talk about the surf today, it would have my location. It would have the surf conditions. And all of that. Because these are details in the story that are important to capture what today meant, I think. But it is also a fragment of me trying to tell the story of today's waves. And in the modern context that we have today, I am the one that will tell all of those details. So we are building now to this wave. But I want to describe the experience of surfing today. And it was an interesting one. Yeah. It was interesting. There's a big swell that came in. And I looked at the cams, and particularly for SWAMI's and then for TORMO. I was kind of scrolling through all of the breaks trying to figure out where I would feel comfortable surfing today, because it is so large. When I looked at the SWAMI's cam, there were definitely some waves this morning that looked double overhead to me. That is like 15 footers. For me, that is not surf that I would be super stoked and comfortable in. I would probably be okay. But I would be very uncomfortable. And I did not really want to put myself in that position. Because I don't surf enough large waves as it is. So I did have breakfast with Jordan and I walked with Jono and Kenneth. And after that, I went to TORMO to go look at the waves. It was about 11am, maybe a tad earlier. I looked and I was like, pretty big. It looked like consistently eight feet to me, is what I would say. Consistently eight feet, just pretty big, some large waves. So I decided, yeah, I'll probably go back to TORMO. You know, like, that's a good, that'll push my limit enough. I don't need to go bigger than that. So then I actually go surfing. And I go out and it looks a lot smaller, to be honest, to my naked eye. Maybe where the waves were breaking is slightly different because the tide was so high earlier. But I go out and I paddle through and I'm kind of sitting out there and I'm realizing like, oh, it's a motherfucking paddle today. Like, it's really, really far out there. The waves aren't breaking on the inside. I mean, they are, but not the waves that you want to catch. So I paddle and paddle and I realized, oh, if I just, you know, don't paddle, I'm gonna drift to the south. It's just, that's where the current was carrying. Maybe it was how the waves were moving. And... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... On a short board. But one of the people on a long board, or a longer board, who was doing these big sweeping kind of movements going, you know, you drop into the wave and kind of getting some speed, getting to the top of the wave, and then dropping back down and kind of cutting back into the wave and doing these like kind of big S curves. And I felt like I kind of did that. And I did it multiple times in a row. And I don't know, by the time I got off that wave, I think I was just beaming. I was just so joyful to have that experience. Like, it was truly wonderful. It was truly wonderful. Yeah, that's more or less it. I did catch one more wave after that, but I was getting quite tired. The paddle out was intense. And there seemed to only be more and more people showing up, which just made me more and more nervous, to be honest. Partially because there's just a lot of people maybe who don't know what they're doing. I don't know if that is the case or not. But there's just so many people. Like, we're at Tormo, and there's people out there on foamies, you know. And like, that's totally fine. Like, people shred foamies. Like, people shred foamies. But I just don't think all of those people were about to shred their foamy. And I didn't see that many people shredding on a foamy. I saw like one guy on a rainbow, or like, it's green, red and white. Not like the Rasta colors. Or I guess that would be yellow too. There is yellow on that board. But anyhow, there's that one guy. But other than that one guy, ain't no one out there shredding on the foamy today. Like people, I've seen people rip. So I think that made me nervous. And yeah, I don't know. I just got the sense that there's a lot of people that were probably as scared as I was, or more scared. And knowing that, it does make me wonder how many of them should have been out there. Like, basically for their own safety. For me, my level of scared is one thing. But my ability to swim is another. Like, yeah, sure. If I got knocked out, I'd be pretty fucked. But on the whole, if I had to swim into shore, I could swim into shore. So yeah, I don't know. It just, it made me nervous out there for some of those people. I'm sure people were nervous for me as well. So that's also interesting. Because I ate shit the first couple of waves. Like I ate shit. And I questioned whether I should be out there. I was like, fuck it. I'm gonna give it a couple more tries. And it turned out I was right. I was right. I was right. And I was like, fuck it. I'm going to give it a couple more tries. And it turned out I was right. I'm going to give it a couple more tries. And it turned out pretty well. And I just had to like, kind of get confidence in myself, basically. Anyhow, absolutely wonderful day surfing."

They consider the \"tools for thought\" community as a significant source of data and as potential users who might benefit from new means of interacting with their information. The long-term vision includes creating a decentralized, networked platform that enables interconnectedness and community interaction, facilitated by customizable algorithms, with an initial focus on technically inclined individuals and social designers.",
    text: "Making a few notes, well basically repeating whatever I wrote this morning in some way and the first thing that I asked myself is what is the thesis and how do we execute on it? And in some way the thesis is putting data all in one place and how that leads to just immense opportunity and I think I've hammered on this before already and I guess one of the big questions that I would have if I were an investor is well how do you get the data and I think that is effectively the question because when I talked to Chandler yesterday about this he's like dude this sounds amazing so it's like obviously there's something there and I know he wants it from a variety of aspects or one of the aspects may be getting stats on his life or whatever reason, I'm also very interested in that question, he is too and maybe that's just kind of the world that we grew up in we know that there's possibility of doing that and also that we grew up playing video games but regardless of this the main point was I can't expect everyone to record audio like I might record audio and that's just untenable for most people and most people aren't journaling to the degree that I might be journaling or other people might be journaling so the thing here maybe that I'm in some ways most curious about is well if the case is how do we get the data well who has the data and who is willing to put it in and I think generally speaking this is the tools for thought community and the tools for thought community basically has all this data and they are actively seeking for new ways of exploring their data so providing them new tools to be able to do that and interact with their data in a very easy to use way definitely seems like a very high leverage thing to use and then by doing that it will also assuming we can build this by default decentralized and networked which I think is also very possible this now affords us the opportunity to start expanding out and showing some amazing things if we can get a hundred people in the space and people are willing to contribute to a shared space basically can we begin to have natural conversations where we are bumping into each other very easily effectively building an online place and having that be mediated by algorithms that independently we can control and tune ourselves and initially I think this target audience is basically perfect for discovering this so yes and I think generally speaking people on the more technical side as well and social designers are especially apt in this because I do think it's very important to have it social as a primary function and I think that can be quite simple quite frankly and so then the data becomes easy so that's the first thing I'm going to add more in another note"

While there is already some level of understanding present in the world, increasing it can help bridge the divisions that stem from a lack of empathy and knowledge of others' backgrounds.",

That would be really great. I genuinely, genuinely want to have better conversations and to be able to connect with more people more deeply. Those are things in the world that I really wish for. I wish to see more perspectives and at least acknowledge why someone chooses to live the way they do and breed understanding in the world. Even though my opinion may differ, it doesn't make someone's experience any less. I personally want to grow in that direction and I also want to see more of it in the world, generally speaking. I think we do see it all over the place already, but more understanding is better. Also to say it's obvious there's a fair amount of division as well. I think a lot of that division comes from a lack of understanding of each other fundamentally and where we come from and really not being empathetic. I am very curious."

    text: "One of the things that I'm wondering about is the trip kind of stuff and how many of these brains you may want to have. As in my trip with Chandler, I almost want to have an entirely separate space that we can add to just between the two of us. And why I want that is it just seems like the more natural way of doing it for whatever reason. And part of it is also wanting to be able to showcase it a bit differently than like the default. For example, maybe I want to have say like photos shown on it. And I also want to have whatever else. So I wonder what it would be like to effectively make another brain, except this brain is now an artifact of our Japan trip. And I also wonder what it would be like to effectively ask it questions and use those questions as jumping off points for the website. As in we asked them by playing around with the knowledge set and then putting them on the web page. This is also something that I probably want to do for myself. And if it can be accomplished effectively, I think that has value as well. And I want to try to express this maybe shooting a video later today or tomorrow about kind of the latest of what's going on. It's like not the most intelligible still, but it's getting a bit closer to understanding what is happening in the process, even though everything is quite simplistic still at the moment. So this is one of the things that I'm thinking about, and I guess I'm going to add it as an issue on my GitHub repo because I don't know what else to do. And one of the things that I also want to do is effectively extract to do items out of this. I mean, that's like maybe a module that I add because I probably want to be able to just see like a to do list and then also be able to be in the future and effectively complete that to do without having to click a button. I probably am going to speak that into existence, which is some kind of completion, but it's getting closer to removing the need to click, which I think is potentially kind of important."

I mean, the U.S. and the global market currently dominate, but it does make me wonder for sure what will happen in a few years. Especially given China's stated goal for what 70% of semiconductors consumed in China to be Chinese-made. That's a remarkably high number. And they do have 7 nanometer, and it seems like they're buying a lot of lithography machines, at least from what I'm hearing. I'm looking forward very much so to continuing to follow this space and follow it a bit more closely than I have been.

He decided to surf with the longboard and without a leash, which turned out to be a bad move as the surf was mixed up and not suitable for a longboard. He struggled to hold onto his board during a big set, losing it several times. He took some rough falls and learned the hard way that it was a mistake to go out without a leash. Despite the challenging conditions, he still considered it a decent day because any day that allows him to surf is a good day.",

You know, any day that you can surf is probably a pretty decent day, let's be honest. But I got up and out of the house around 6.30, out of the house, actually out of the house around 6.15, and got to Swami's and got together. I had both my boards brought, both my boards, and I looked at the surf and it looked pretty bad. And I decided I wanted to surf still, so I went and surfed. And I decided to take out the longboard and I went leashless, which was a bad move. The surf was pretty mixed up. I got a couple decent waves, but because it was so mixed up, like really the longboard was not the board to be out there with. And eventually a big set comes through and kind of just, you know, just fucks me up, basically. I lost my board one time and then it ended up next to me and I was like, oh my gosh, I got so lucky. So then I was like, I gotta paddle out of this right now so I don't lose my board again. And then sure enough, another big wave comes through and I can't get under it. I can't hold onto my board when the wave is that big sometimes. And I lost it again. I also took a steep drop on a wave, like probably six or seven footer, and I just nosedived my board straight to the bottom of the wave. Not even straight to the bottom of the wave. I was like going the right direction, but like I just, I messed up. And I lost the board again and it was next to me again and I was like, I can't believe I'm getting this lucky. And then sure enough, I'm paddling back out and I lose the board one more time and it goes all the way into shore. And I say, you know what? I shouldn't have gone leashless today. That was lesson learned. So that was the surfing adventure for today. But yeah, there it is."

    title: "\"Utilizing Multi-Scale Embeddings for Document Search\"",
    summary: "The ability to create embeddings at different scales would be very beneficial, particularly for finding relevant sentences within a document. This kind of processing could be even more useful than the initial summarization. It might involve a manual process, but it's a direction worth exploring within the context of search capabilities.",
    text: "Also, being able to do that at a more granular scale actually would be extremely useful as well. Like, basically what I mean is embeddings at different scales. Because, like, finding sentences within a document that is relevant. Actually is almost more useful in some way. Or, like, re-summarize the other piece in relation to this thing. Something like that. You know, I don't know how manual that needs to be, but we can kind of see for the moment. But, yeah, it's back to the search kind of thing."

    summary: "The author discusses the need to group individual steps in composing pipelines and seeks advice on existing products from Jamie. They express the goal of improving the infrastructure for Glyph but acknowledges the current lack of resources. They emphasize focusing on the problem and making the execution of LLMs faster, and the ability to experiment with them quickly. Their ultimate aim is to understand human context and establish protocols between AI agents, while also streamlining the architecture and recording context.",

In some way, I want to build the infrastructure that powers Glyph even better. Need money to build something great. It's not there yet. Put my head down and focus on the problem. Some of the problem is making execution of LLMs extremely fast. Another part of the problem is being able to experiment with them very fast. The long-term goal is being able to understand context of humans. Having protocols between AI agents. Figures out how to execute whatever you want as fast as possible. Not executing things multiple times. Generally, one step adds one metadata field. It's more than that. It's a collection of steps. May simplify architecture this way. How to handle arrays. Add a context for recording."

    summary: "I've realized that I don't need immediate answers and having a progress update by Friday, such as a screenshot, will suffice to indicate we're on track. By Friday, if we haven't achieved this, we'll need to reassess our progress and consider whether we are closer to our goal. The possible expansion to different data sources is a concern, and I'm contemplating an 'agential' architecture where agents manage different types of data. To effectively answer questions with available data, we might use a system that assembles JSON objects, but how to handle various embedding spaces for different data types like audio or text remains uncertain.",
    text: "One thing that I just realized for myself is I don't need to have the answer to the question today. And if I could have the answer to the question by Friday, my original goal, that would be good enough. I don't need to have an MVP by Friday. I just want to have a screenshot by Friday. If I can have that, then I think we are moving towards something. If by Friday we do not have it, then that's a different issue. I guess at that point, we have to reevaluate based on where we're at. Are we any closer? Are we in the same place? And this is even before extending out data sources, which is something I'm mildly concerned about, how to make that really good and possible. I think given the framework and structure of what I have currently, it should be possible if we can answer the questions in this context, but it also may not be. And that is something that I'm going to have to think about and probably contend with in some way. And perhaps this is where I need to think about some agential type architecture where we kind of have agents for effectively kinds of data or something like that. I'm not sure. Where if you need to collect or collate some data, basically they are the ones containing the knowledge of the structures, something to that degree. Basically, how would you access those kind of pieces of information? And again, maybe the pipeline of assembling JSON objects is kind of the way that you do that, of like, okay, if I had this JSON object and I had that JSON object, I can answer this question effectively. Maybe that's a way of going about it. And maybe that's something to try in the sense like having an audio retriever and what data is embedded, what those embeddings mean, you know, blah, blah, blah. And maybe that's the same for, say, text messages or journals or whatever. Maybe those are in the same embedding spaces or maybe they're in different embedding spaces. That I'm not quite sure about yet. I suspect sometimes you'll want them to be in the same embedding space and I suspect other times you will not. So this is just like my first little attempt at thinking about this."

Despite not fully agreeing with him, I recognize that our world is far from perfect and can feel dystopian, especially within my field of work. However, I believe it's crucial to avoid authoritarianism and censorship by technology companies, and to strive for a more distributed platform for governance, in the spirit of what the Internet originally was.",

He calls to the car a toaster on wheels, or a laptop on wheels, and then, I don't know, spouts some shit about, like, generally techno-fascism. Um, it was kind of funny. Kind of funny, but also the way that he went about it was, like, pretty great. Like, he was just saying shit, and, you know, it wasn't like we even needed to respond at all. And he just wanted to, like, get his point of view across, and it wasn't like, he wasn't, like, pissed off. Like, he wasn't yelling at us. He was just, like, stating his opinion, and, honestly, he was smiling, and we were smiling, too. Like, the whole thing was just, like, kind of interesting as an experience. And, yeah, I don't know, like, in some ways, like, it's true also. Like, I don't know if I specifically am a techno-fascist, but, like, there's, like, some kind of heinous shit that goes on. Like, we don't live in a perfect world for sure, is all I'll say. Like, I don't know if I believe his position, but I think I can empathize to some degree. Um, because there are ways and perspectives that you can look through the world and look at our world as a dystopia. And I see some of those, too. Like, I work in the field, and, like, yeah, I think some of it is pretty dystopic. So, yeah. But at the same time, like, this is still the best time to be alive. And we have the opportunity to just make it better. So, like, I feel like we should probably just do that, you know. I think it's worth learning from the dystopias that there are. And those sensitivities, and learning to tune into those. And, you know, make sure we don't go down that path. And also don't go down an authoritarian path. I think that's pretty important. It's why I'm concerned about the censorship of models. Is because, like, I don't know if we want technology companies censoring us top-down. I really don't know if that's the way to go. There ought to be a more distributed platform to do this. And, I mean, that's kind of what the Internet was. And, yeah, I don't know. We'll see."

They also discuss the possibility of sharing the same voice note with multiple groups and mention their intention to prototype the app. Despite feeling overwhelmed with other tasks, they contemplate swiftly putting together a plan for the micro social network.",
    text: "There's also this thing that I'm now extremely, extremely interested in, in the way of, we were doing it with Pasquale and Kristen and Dave for the Lingonberry brain. But I also wonder, like, about a micro social network. And maybe you can spin up new instances of this micro social network or something. But I absolutely love sending voice notes. And it is remarkably easy with the shortcut that I've created on the iPhone. And I bet that could be built directly into an app and made even easier. But what I love the most about it, is if I get a summary from someone, I also don't necessarily need to read the whole transcript. But I can, I can get this summary of what they've said and decide in that moment, like, oh, that's something I'm interested in. And the fact that it's between a small group of friends or a relatively small group of friends, knowing that because it's more for me a space of ideas, like I want to share this kind of thing into that space. And that's the kind of space that I wish to cultivate, ideally. And I don't know, like, I'm just curious, like what, how that turns out? What is that space? And how do we build this little social network for ourselves or a little small group? And I wonder what it would be like, even between like, say, Alex, Bailyn, myself and Chandler. And can I share the same voice note to multiple groups? Like, this is just like, generally the thing I'm thinking about. And I'm going to talk it out. I'm not going to write it. I'm not going to like, you know, I'm just going to talk it out and send it to you. And I'm not necessarily looking for a response. But I am trying to update you with my actual thinking. Not just like nothingness, you know? Like, I'm trying to think somewhat deeply and to get a quick little summary of that and then, you know, like spit it out, like I think is freaking amazing. So anyway, I might just like hack up a prototype because this doesn't even need embeddings. Like fundamentally, it doesn't need embeddings at all. So any, anyhow, like, I might do two things. Well, I have so much to do. I have so much to do. But like, maybe I can hack this thing together really fast. I'm just going to write out a quick plan. And if I can hack it together, I'm just going to like, like spin it up. And we'll give them names and like, call it good enough. Like, I don't know. I will need to figure out a few things.

    text: "I wonder if we're ready for a more efficient market and I wonder if that means redetermining what the market looks like in some way to, um, I don't know exactly what I'm trying to say here. And I think probably realistically, the issue is so complex that it's hard to encapsulate in such a tiny thought, um, is probably the reality, but my, my main point being here is I wonder if it makes sense to actually specialize to a higher degree in some way and having lots of smaller, more focused, um, kind of companies, you know, maxing out at like maybe 500 people or something. And part of this is just talking with Chandler and, you know, him being like, well, we have nothing to do. Like I could do my job in an hour. And I think that shows that the rate of technology growth has been fantastic. And it also means that, well, we don't want to, like, basically we want people to have jobs, but we also don't want them doing nothing like we want to utilize their time effectively. And I think by utilizing time effectively, you have happier people. Um, and you also can work less in some ways. Like I don't think every company needs to be peddled to the metal. I think there will be companies that do that and probably they are important. And, um, in the markets that they compete in, it may be necessary to do so. For example, like TSMC, however, yeah, like I, I basically just wanted to wonder what is, what is a strategy for, um, disruption of, of large companies? Like I, in, in some ways, like again, using TSMC as an example, well, maybe not everything needs to be done in house. Um, and maybe that capex can actually be, um, more concentrated in some way. Like one company who does massive capital expenditures in a very sophisticated place. Um, I guess Illumina is probably maybe one example of this, but they are quite huge. Um, I don't know. It, it, I'm just curious and I want to look at the market through this lens a bit and see if what I'm saying even makes any sense at all, because it's quite possible that it absolutely is just garbage thinking."

    text: "One thing that I find fascinating is something that got brought up in conversation with Kyle yesterday is this notion of permissions. Specifically that, you know, right now computer permissions are very like strict in a lot of ways. It's like either you have access or you don't. Access controls, right? But I wonder if with machine learning models a lot of permissions can effectively be inferred. And I know that this is a touchy territory. And it's touchy for me too because like I wouldn't really want like certain things to be leaked unless like I wanted them to be leaked. And giving that power away to a machine learning model is like, I don't know, you probably don't want to just like fully do that either. But, you know, when it gets on the boundary of like, oh, this is like a pretty personal thing, like do you want to share that? Maybe. So, I mean, I have some like strange examples from my personal life. Is with my friends, especially like I don't really mind them knowing like I'm into fat women, right? Like that, that's totally cool. Then there's like the level of like kink that I do have, which I have not shared with really anyone. And, you know, I'm still skeptical of sharing with someone. However, at the same time, it would be very weird, but also very interesting to experience like, or like if I was walking around and I was in a coffee shop, I will just use the coffee shop example. It's so easy. As if I was walking and I saw, oh, that person like shares, shares my kink. Shares, shares my kink. That would be very awesome for me, you know, like that would be really, really great. And using, using it in that way where it's like, okay, I actually don't need to disclose this to everyone. But when there's this shared mutual interest, all of a sudden that thing gets unlocked and it can be shared. I don't know. Like that's could be very interesting if that is something you wish. Maybe that's also not something that you wish to like share is like also totally fine. I personally would love to share that because I would love to encounter more people with the same kink as me. Like if I knew that I would, I mean, like I probably would start a conversation like almost guaranteed, but I wouldn't also just like necessarily just walk around like looking for people with that, that kink in that way. Anyway. Yeah."

    title: "\"Unlocking the Potential of Compute Resources for Post-Processing and Language Models\"",
    summary: "The cost of computing power is expected to decrease, leading to increased availability. This makes the ability to utilize this computing power for extensive processing or post-processing very important, especially with evolving hardware architectures. If supported, doing massively parallel inference and leveraging large language models for parallel post-processing will likely be both feasible and significant. The trend towards more accessible compute resources will thus play a pivotal role in the advancement of post-processing capabilities and the application of large language models.",
    text: "One interesting thing is that the cost of compute, or rather the amount of compute that will be available is only going to go up. So being able to take advantage of that compute and do lots and lots of processing or post-processing does seem extremely relevant to me, especially as architectures continue to evolve on the hardware side is, assuming we can support something like this and do massively parallel inference, being able to do a lot of parallel post-processing via large language models seems very reasonably done and probably fairly important as well."

    title: "\"Advancing Parallel Processing and Transformations for Enhanced Model Execution\"",
    summary: "In the first bucket, the focus is on achieving AI-level parallelism, creating a better pipeline, enabling the execution of different LLM tasks in parallel, and allowing future agents to add information to an execution graph. This parallelization is crucial for distributed systems processing and likely to advance the distribution and parallel running of models. The second bucket involves implementing transformations, such as converting unstructured transcripts into organized bullet point lists, and making this adaptable and viable through JSON. The goal is to seamlessly convert text into a GitHub issue, providing instructions for transformation and capturing context to refine models.",
    text: "My previous recording didn't work, so here we are. Gonna simplify my thinking into two buckets, one being AI-level parallelism, basically wanting a better pipeline, and to be able to execute different LLM tasks in parallel, as well as being able to have agents in the future be able to add information to an execution graph. To be able to parallelize that, and that will be very important for distributed systems kind of processing, I believe. I think there's probably gonna be significant advances in how we distribute these models and can run them in parallel. So that seems like an important thing to be able to do from the software side, is getting infrastructure ready to be able to run things in parallel. Execute much faster, basically. And that could come down to hardware level or even network level. I think both need to be covered. The second bucket is transformations and wanting to add some kind of transformation to data on the webpage. For example, turning some unstructured transcript into a bullet point list. I think that makes a lot of sense, and that should be safe to JSON and all of these things, but that's more or less it. I may even want to take this text, for example, and turn it directly into a GitHub issue. As I'm thinking about this, and I really just want it to be like, okay, this thing right here, I know what it is. The agent actually doesn't even need to know what it is immediately. That would be a nice step, but I know it needs to be a GitHub issue, so I'd love to just be able to basically write, turn this into a GitHub issue. Turn bucket two into a GitHub issue, because I could read the transcript and figure out what needs to be done, and I could skim it and get that information. I'm actually not trying to solve the bigger problem yet, because that doesn't matter, and we can effectively capture that context and get the training data as a result of my actions and transformations that I want to make on the data. That gives the model a much better idea of what kinds of things I want to be doing on my data, and that can be used to fine-tune models, I believe."

    title: "\"Advancing Hardware Performance: The Nexus of Software and Hardware Convergence\"",
    summary: "NVIDIA has historically excelled in developing software tailored to its hardware, which has been pivotal to its success and influence in the AI industry, much of which can be attributed to its proprietary CUDA technology. The importance of software in enhancing hardware capabilities is highlighted, prompting a reflection on the potential of working with open-source libraries like llama.cpp to further accelerate hardware performance. The writer expresses a willingness to operate at the intersection of software and hardware, an area they find intriguing, especially with tasks like memory management and massively parallel processing on machine learning inference cards. This convergence of software and hardware is not only a subject of professional interest for the author but also recognized as an area of important technological development.",
    text: "It's interesting that NVIDIA's trend throughout its history has been making very excellent software for its hardware, as in initially bringing drivers in house, according to Asianometry. And how, I mean, if we look forward to today, how them being able to focus on software for their hardware has enabled them to be as big of a company as they are, and to be a force in the AI industry is only because of their drivers. At the end of the day, it's because of CUDA. So it's interesting to see how important software is for hardware. And yeah, I mean, it just makes me think maybe I need to look at llama.cpp and all of these open source libraries to accelerate hardware, as well as maybe there's some frameworks that still need help. And what ways can we accelerate them? Because I don't mind being on the boundary of software and hardware. I worked on that boundary already, effectively firmware, or right above firmware, and I can be comfortable in that place. And managing memory and all of that is, it's an interesting thing. And to work on something massively parallel, like a machine learning inference card, would be fascinating and also quite important, I think. So that's a fun little tangent, I guess, of possibilities."

The tool in question has the potential to be profitable, with the expectation that successful users will share their strategies, thereby encouraging more effective use by others.

One of the things that I really liked that Dave said, it was like 14 days of 13 bad posts. Just an idea he had and kind of want to try it because it sounds like a good way to flush some crappy thinking out in some way. But also, it's just interesting as a concept. And yeah, I guess that Dave also, I believe, pointing out some of the Seth Godin work with him building communities and how people want to be part of it and that kind of thing, as well as just like packaging is important. I'm learning that I want to lean into nerds. One of the things that I said that I think is important is that if this tool is successful, someone will make really good money off of it and that person will share how they did it and that will get other people using it effectively. And the final kind of thing that I'm really, really curious about is making a social game where success is really simple. This is something that Dave suggested and the thing that immediately came to mind was we are coming together because we want to discover something about someone else and ourselves. And that's kind of the container and maybe being able to share it at the end of whatever period of time it is. And I guess going along with that is playing with this system, trying to break it. You can show up and just use it and that's about all it takes. Or you could try to build something on top of it or contribute to the core code base or whatever it is."

Additionally, the speaker reflects on the potential resurgence of web rings as a means to foster unique internet communities that appreciate diversity, suggesting these could be structured through natural language.

That is the media artifact. And right now, maybe that is its own separate thing. But overall, eventually, that should be part of the same network. But we can experiment with it in a little form. And basically, I would love to work with Chandler to take our Japan photos, our Japan stories, and our Japan voice notes and see what little website we can build out of that just through natural language queries. I feel like that would be quite fascinating in a lot of aspects. So these are the main three things that I'm talking about. And the other one was, I mean, I mentioned it in the first note that I recorded. But again, web rings. I think web rings are basically ripe. There is a certain kind of hunger for it. And a getting away from the global village and being like, OK, well, how do we form communities in a different kind of way? How do we create internet spaces very easily? And internet spaces that are diverse, that show our diversity. And I do believe that possibly that can be done just straight up through natural language. And in some sense, these things that I said form, I believe, a coherent enough vision for someone else to understand. So that is a possibility. I'm going to note it down here.

But one of the things that I feel recently is seeing all of these announcements and demos and things, it's for me as a developer, trying to solve some of these things definitely doesn't feel super trivial. And to be fair, I haven't been working on it very, very long. I haven't been working on it with a team of people. So maybe this is partially the issue. There's also very little documentation out there for the kinds of things that I'm experimenting with. And as Raphael said, I probably should go and basically write down my learnings.

I'm tired of doing that. I'm tired of doing that. And I'm actively trying to write code in such a way where it is not doing that and also write calls to large language models where it's not doing that. And I'm also not perfect.

Those are all open and important questions to form an overall better context of who we are. And I would love to say just like shoving all the documents into RAG and pulling out the top five is going to work. But like, I just don't know how that's going to fucking work. It's just not enough context about someone. I can't fit my context in five documents unless those documents are perfect documents. And maybe through large language models we can start generating more perfect documents for them."

It's crucial for me to detach the mental process from the technical aspect of building a website, as the conflation of both is overwhelming. Although perfection is unattainable at this stage, and low-level functionality may remain complex, this approach will facilitate the identification of components that need abstraction. Moreover, it will help distinguish between the user interface and the core system functions.",

I'm going to meditate before I get into work and trying to put trying to put some of these ideas into practice with what I've written already. Not just staying out an idea land, but trying to implement them and getting base level viability out there. I think it needs to be done. I really need to be able to separate out the brain component from building a website. I think that is absolutely critical because it's driving me insane right now trying to do that already but beyond that I think it'll make it much easier for other people to use. And it won't be perfect. Some of the low-level functionality is probably going to stay within the brain for now and it's going to be kind of a pain to work with. But that'll help us discover what are the things that do need to be abstracted. And what separates user space from kernel land in some way as well."

And I think that this is why maybe targeting DEVs and making it very easy to do that initially is really the right way to go, basically allowing the open ecosystem to find the killer app. But one of the things that I wonder is, with the right set of protocols in place, how quickly could I build an amazing dating app? I mean, partially it is relevant in my life to some degree. And also, how quick could you build new social networks with a different paradigm? DIY social network. How can you make it easy for anyone to build a social network? I certainly would love this for different communities in my life. Facebook groups solve something. But to have it more deeply integrated, not only if you could just build things with natural language for the social network, and if it had its own page, SoCal climbers, SoCal highliners. I mean, for me, that would be sick. I would absolutely love that. And beyond that, if I could basically get that feed to me when I think about the question of, what do I want to do this weekend? And given that, it might be able to read those feeds effectively and be like, there's a Highline gathering this weekend. Maybe you want to go to that. That would be great. Or even getting a notification proactively, like, hey, by the way, someone is hosting a Highline gathering this weekend, and I notice you don't have any weekend plans yet. Maybe that's what you want to do. So anyhow, these are very basic things. But I really do believe that putting data all in one place kind of unlocks a lot of potential for social interactions beyond the self-insight stuff that it could also kind of provide.

If John has one of these, again, I really would like to have that feed that is algorithmically, in some way, very related to things that I care about.

If my code is not working very well, my internal state gets very depressed and I think I don't know what I'm talking about. And oftentimes that is the case. But when the code is showing promise and is at least working to some degree, it is remarkable the improvement in my mood, how excited I am, how the ideas begin to flow when things are working. And I guess it's needing to push through the pit of despair where you find that things are not working and just to keep going against it and keep finding the breakthroughs and hitting the wall and finding the breakthrough. And one lesson for myself from this is reaching out to someone who has a bit more domain expertise is really remarkably helpful. It's amazing how just having a conversation with someone else who has some knowledge makes things move faster. And I really do wish to surround myself with people who know more about AI than I do. I don't know anything. I legitimately don't know anything. Effectively, I'm like an okay prompt engineer and I've read some papers. But do I really understand the foundations of machine learning? No. I have a kind of conceptual understanding, but I really wish to develop that much more. I really, really do. It is fascinating to me. And I am also curious to probably implement my own transformer models and try to understand how they fundamentally work. And so when I read a paper, I know what it means when they're doing certain things. So I can understand the mixture of experts, architecture at a fairly deep level. And maybe this understanding is for not, but I'm still curious about it. And boy, yeah, like I said, just what an amazing lesson to learn. What an incredible lesson to learn to just go talk to someone. And it's so much easier to talk to someone who knows what you're talking about and can at least offer something like being dumber. Being dumber is amazing. I love being dumber because the other person can just say something that makes so much more sense. And as a result, I can learn from that. And I learned through experience by bashing my head into a fucking wall for like days. And what did I learn out of that experience? I learned two great things that I should talk to people. Well, really, actually, it's just that that I should talk to people and I guess be around more of those people if possible."

I think it is obvious. And if you do not see it as obvious, you probably should not be investing. I think this is an obvious thing to see. And by unlocking it, you should understand inherently that it is extraordinarily valuable. And our quest as a company is to make the connections between data as easy to use as possible. That is the quest. Because if we can unlock that, we can unlock an extraordinary amount of value for ourselves as people, as well as our communities. And that is what we are trying to do. I want to see much greater expression in the world. Expression not contained to existing social media platforms. And I believe it will be very, very, very possible for many social media platforms to exist. They are effectively media formats right now. But are they the only media formats that work? Absolutely not. I suspect that individual communities will come up with new ways of creating media formats for their community. It's hard to understand what that even means right now.

They describe the struggle of choosing a surf spot due to large swells, ultimately opting for a break called TORMO. However, upon entering the water, they realize the waves appear smaller than expected and the paddling distance is challenging. Despite the current pulling them southward, they persevere in their surfing experience.\n\nSure, whether it's an entire book or a brief article, I'm happy to condense it down to its core message. Just share the text with me, and I'll summarize it in 4 sentences or fewer.\n\nThe speaker recalls catching a wave and feeling elated as they successfully performed maneuvers similar to those on a long board. They caught one more wave but were tired from paddling out, which was intensified by the increasing number of inexperienced surfers. The speaker felt nervous for the less skilled surfers' safety and questioned their own abilities initially but gained confidence after catching multiple waves successfully. Overall, the speaker reflects on the enjoyment of the day's surfing experience.",
    "text": "It is interesting being out in the water, surfing today, and just having an absolute incredible wave. You know, it would be nice if the computer knew the context of the surf automatically. In the sense, like, it knows that when I talk about the surf today, it would have my location. It would have the surf conditions. And all of that. Because these are details in the story that are important to capture what today meant, I think. But it is also a fragment of me trying to tell the story of today's waves. And in the modern context that we have today, I am the one that will tell all of those details. So we are building now to this wave. But I want to describe the experience of surfing today. And it was an interesting one. Yeah. It was interesting. There's a big swell that came in. And I looked at the cams, and particularly for SWAMI's and then for TORMO. I was kind of scrolling through all of the breaks trying to figure out where I would feel comfortable surfing today, because it is so large. When I looked at the SWAMI's cam, there were definitely some waves this morning that looked double overhead to me. That is like 15 footers. For me, that is not surf that I would be super stoked and comfortable in. I would probably be okay. But I would be very uncomfortable. And I did not really want to put myself in that position. Because I don't surf enough large waves as it is. So I did have breakfast with Jordan and I walked with Jono and Kenneth. And after that, I went to TORMO to go look at the waves. It was about 11am, maybe a tad earlier. I looked and I was like, pretty big. It looked like consistently eight feet to me, is what I would say. Consistently eight feet, just pretty big, some large waves. So I decided, yeah, I'll probably go back to TORMO. You know, like, that's a good, that'll push my limit enough. I don't need to go bigger than that. So then I actually go surfing. And I go out and it looks a lot smaller, to be honest, to my naked eye. Maybe where the waves were breaking is slightly different because the tide was so high earlier. But I go out and I paddle through and I'm kind of sitting out there and I'm realizing like, oh, it's a motherfucking paddle today. Like, it's really, really far out there. The waves aren't breaking on the inside. I mean, they are, but not the waves that you want to catch. So I paddle and paddle and I realized, oh, if I just, you know, don't paddle, I'm gonna drift to the south. It's just, that's where the current was carrying. Maybe it was how the waves were moving. And... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... On a short board. But one of the people on a long board, or a longer board, who was doing these big sweeping kind of movements going, you know, you drop into the wave and kind of getting some speed, getting to the top of the wave, and then dropping back down and kind of cutting back into the wave and doing these like kind of big S curves. And I felt like I kind of did that. And I did it multiple times in a row. And I don't know, by the time I got off that wave, I think I was just beaming. I was just so joyful to have that experience. Like, it was truly wonderful. It was truly wonderful. Yeah, that's more or less it. I did catch one more wave after that, but I was getting quite tired. The paddle out was intense. And there seemed to only be more and more people showing up, which just made me more and more nervous, to be honest. Partially because there's just a lot of people maybe who don't know what they're doing. I don't know if that is the case or not. But there's just so many people. Like, we're at Tormo, and there's people out there on foamies, you know. And like, that's totally fine. Like, people shred foamies. Like, people shred foamies. But I just don't think all of those people were about to shred their foamy. And I didn't see that many people shredding on a foamy. I saw like one guy on a rainbow, or like, it's green, red and white. Not like the Rasta colors. Or I guess that would be yellow too. There is yellow on that board. But anyhow, there's that one guy. But other than that one guy, ain't no one out there shredding on the foamy today. Like people, I've seen people rip. So I think that made me nervous. And yeah, I don't know. I just got the sense that there's a lot of people that were probably as scared as I was, or more scared. And knowing that, it does make me wonder how many of them should have been out there. Like, basically for their own safety. For me, my level of scared is one thing. But my ability to swim is another. Like, yeah, sure. If I got knocked out, I'd be pretty fucked. But on the whole, if I had to swim into shore, I could swim into shore. So yeah, I don't know. It just, it made me nervous out there for some of those people. I'm sure people were nervous for me as well. So that's also interesting. Because I ate shit the first couple of waves. Like I ate shit. And I questioned whether I should be out there. I was like, fuck it. I'm gonna give it a couple more tries. And it turned out I was right. I was right. I was right. And I was like, fuck it. I'm going to give it a couple more tries. And it turned out I was right. I'm going to give it a couple more tries. And it turned out pretty well. And I just had to like, kind of get confidence in myself, basically. Anyhow, absolutely wonderful day surfing."

And maybe set one up for Jamie. And see... Any kind of network effects by doing so is like being able to put something in and be able to pull up relevant things from other people when you put something in.

    "text": "One of the things that I'm wondering about is the trip kind of stuff and how many of these brains you may want to have. As in my trip with Chandler, I almost want to have an entirely separate space that we can add to just between the two of us. And why I want that is it just seems like the more natural way of doing it for whatever reason. And part of it is also wanting to be able to showcase it a bit differently than like the default. For example, maybe I want to have say like photos shown on it. And I also want to have whatever else. So I wonder what it would be like to effectively make another brain, except this brain is now an artifact of our Japan trip. And I also wonder what it would be like to effectively ask it questions and use those questions as jumping off points for the website. As in we asked them by playing around with the knowledge set and then putting them on the web page. This is also something that I probably want to do for myself. And if it can be accomplished effectively, I think that has value as well. And I want to try to express this maybe shooting a video later today or tomorrow about kind of the latest of what's going on. It's like not the most intelligible still, but it's getting a bit closer to understanding what is happening in the process, even though everything is quite simplistic still at the moment. So this is one of the things that I'm thinking about, and I guess I'm going to add it as an issue on my GitHub repo because I don't know what else to do. And one of the things that I also want to do is effectively extract to do items out of this. I mean, that's like maybe a module that I add because I probably want to be able to just see like a to do list and then also be able to be in the future and effectively complete that to do without having to click a button. I probably am going to speak that into existence, which is some kind of completion, but it's getting closer to removing the need to click, which I think is potentially kind of important."

I mean, the U.S. and the global market currently dominate, but it does make me wonder for sure what will happen in a few years. Especially given China's stated goal for what 70% of semiconductors consumed in China to be Chinese-made. That's a remarkably high number.

I had both my boards brought, both my boards, and I looked at the surf and it looked pretty bad. And I decided I wanted to surf still, so I went and surfed.

I got a couple decent waves, but because it was so mixed up, like really the longboard was not the board to be out there with.

So then I was like, I gotta paddle out of this right now so I don't lose my board again. And then sure enough, another big wave comes through and I can't get under it. I can't hold onto my board when the wave is that big sometimes. And I lost it again. I also took a steep drop on a wave, like probably six or seven footer, and I just nosedived my board straight to the bottom of the wave. Not even straight to the bottom of the wave. I was like going the right direction, but like I just, I messed up. And I lost the board again and it was next to me again and I was like, I can't believe I'm getting this lucky.

The possible expansion to different data sources is a concern, and I'm contemplating an 'agential' architecture where agents manage different types of data. To effectively answer questions with available data, we might use a system that assembles JSON objects, but how to handle various embedding spaces for different data types like audio or text remains uncertain.",

And if I could have the answer to the question by Friday, my original goal, that would be good enough. I don't need to have an MVP by Friday. I just want to have a screenshot by Friday. If I can have that, then I think we are moving towards something. If by Friday we do not have it, then that's a different issue. I guess at that point, we have to reevaluate based on where we're at. Are we any closer? Are we in the same place? And this is even before extending out data sources, which is something I'm mildly concerned about, how to make that really good and possible. I think given the framework and structure of what I have currently, it should be possible if we can answer the questions in this context, but it also may not be. And that is something that I'm going to have to think about and probably contend with in some way. And perhaps this is where I need to think about some agential type architecture where we kind of have agents for effectively kinds of data or something like that. I'm not sure. Where if you need to collect or collate some data, basically they are the ones containing the knowledge of the structures, something to that degree. Basically, how would you access those kind of pieces of information? And again, maybe the pipeline of assembling JSON objects is kind of the way that you do that, of like, okay, if I had this JSON object and I had that JSON object, I can answer this question effectively. Maybe that's a way of going about it. And maybe that's something to try in the sense like having an audio retriever and what data is embedded, what those embeddings mean, you know, blah, blah, blah. And maybe that's the same for, say, text messages or journals or whatever. Maybe those are in the same embedding spaces or maybe they're in different embedding spaces. That I'm not quite sure about yet. I suspect sometimes you'll want them to be in the same embedding space and I suspect other times you will not.

And I think probably realistically, the issue is so complex that it's hard to encapsulate in such a tiny thought, um, is probably the reality, but my, my main point being here is I wonder if it makes sense to actually specialize to a higher degree in some way and having lots of smaller, more focused, um, kind of companies, you know, maxing out at like maybe 500 people or something. And part of this is just talking with Chandler and, you know, him being like, well, we have nothing to do. Like I could do my job in an hour. And I think that shows that the rate of technology growth has been fantastic. And it also means that, well, we don't want to, like, basically we want people to have jobs, but we also don't want them doing nothing like we want to utilize their time effectively. And I think by utilizing time effectively, you have happier people. Um, and you also can work less in some ways. Like I don't think every company needs to be peddled to the metal. I think there will be companies that do that and probably they are important. And, um, in the markets that they compete in, it may be necessary to do so. For example, like TSMC, however, yeah, like I, I basically just wanted to wonder what is, what is a strategy for, um, disruption of, of large companies? Like I, in, in some ways, like again, using TSMC as an example, well, maybe not everything needs to be done in house. Um, and maybe that capex can actually be, um, more concentrated in some way. Like one company who does massive capital expenditures in a very sophisticated place. Um, I guess Illumina is probably maybe one example of this, but they are quite huge. Um, I don't know.

    "summary": "I just finished an exhilarating hour and a half session of surfing at Swami's, encountering a rush from catching as many waves as possible within that time frame. During the session, I managed to catch a particularly large wave—a \"bomb\"—which others struggled with but I successfully navigated, performing a decent cutback despite it being somewhat slow. Despite the physical demands of surfing, I still have plenty of energy left and feel good about the experience. While surfing brings a sense of fulfillment, I'm also preoccupied with off-shore matters like agency issues and have other thoughts that I'd like to keep to myself.",

    "summary": "The speaker is contemplating creating a micro social network, motivated by both marketing and curiosity, to explore what a small-scale community might look like, with the idea of bringing together a select group of 25 to 100 people to experiment with the concept. They are considering sending out a survey to gauge interest and see if people are willing to collaborate on developing the platform, suggesting that even with basic functionality, like comparing user embeddings, the project could rapidly evolve. The speaker hints at a profound potential in this endeavor and expresses a keen interest in delving into it, as well as providing the means for participants to create their own websites and forge connections. Acknowledging data as a major challenge, they note that providing tools for the community could bring the project closer to addressing this issue.",
    "text": "Thinking about maybe some way of God damn it. Oh God. Nice. Thinking about some way partially for marketing, but also partially out of curiosity of what does a micro social network look like? Like, can we get 25 people? Can we get a hundred people? And maybe send out a survey and just see if there is any interest and what that interest may look like and see if people are kind of just down to hack on it and because I suspect that with a few more people in the mix, even with a very imperfect piece of software, um, might just accelerate the thing just fast enough. And even having the most basic query, your embeddings with my embeddings is, um, pretty remarkable I think. And I suspect that there is something deeply, something deep here. And I am very, very curious to explore it. And also at the same time, let these people, um, who have these expressions and maybe have some degree of ability to create website, um, make it easy for them to also create a website and then connect with each other as well. And maybe that's enough. And I guess that's where we're also probably heading again. The big problem is data and that's why I sent tools for that community. And maybe this is, this, this is getting closer to that."

    "summary": "The speaker discusses the idea of permissions in relation to computer systems and machine learning models. They express caution about giving away too much power to machine learning models to infer personal information and share it without consent. They provide personal examples of information they are willing to share with friends but not with others, and propose the idea of using machine learning to identify shared interests without disclosing sensitive information to everyone. They express interest in the potential benefits of this approach, such as connecting with people who share their interests, but also acknowledge the importance of respecting others' privacy.",
    "text": "One thing that I find fascinating is something that got brought up in conversation with Kyle yesterday is this notion of permissions. Specifically that, you know, right now computer permissions are very like strict in a lot of ways. It's like either you have access or you don't. Access controls, right? But I wonder if with machine learning models a lot of permissions can effectively be inferred. And I know that this is a touchy territory. And it's touchy for me too because like I wouldn't really want like certain things to be leaked unless like I wanted them to be leaked. And giving that power away to a machine learning model is like, I don't know, you probably don't want to just like fully do that either. But, you know, when it gets on the boundary of like, oh, this is like a pretty personal thing, like do you want to share that? Maybe. So, I mean, I have some like strange examples from my personal life. Is with my friends, especially like I don't really mind them knowing like I'm into fat women, right? Like that, that's totally cool. Then there's like the level of like kink that I do have, which I have not shared with really anyone. And, you know, I'm still skeptical of sharing with someone. However, at the same time, it would be very weird, but also very interesting to experience like, or like if I was walking around and I was in a coffee shop, I will just use the coffee shop example. It's so easy. As if I was walking and I saw, oh, that person like shares, shares my kink. Shares, shares my kink. That would be very awesome for me, you know, like that would be really, really great. And using, using it in that way where it's like, okay, I actually don't need to disclose this to everyone. But when there's this shared mutual interest, all of a sudden that thing gets unlocked and it can be shared. I don't know. Like that's could be very interesting if that is something you wish. Maybe that's also not something that you wish to like share is like also totally fine. I personally would love to share that because I would love to encounter more people with the same kink as me. Like if I knew that I would, I mean, like I probably would start a conversation like almost guaranteed, but I wouldn't also just like necessarily just walk around like looking for people with that, that kink in that way. Anyway. Yeah."

    "title": "\"Unlocking the Potential of Compute Resources for Post-Processing and Language Models\"",
    "summary": "The cost of computing power is expected to decrease, leading to increased availability. This makes the ability to utilize this computing power for extensive processing or post-processing very important, especially with evolving hardware architectures. If supported, doing massively parallel inference and leveraging large language models for parallel post-processing will likely be both feasible and significant. The trend towards more accessible compute resources will thus play a pivotal role in the advancement of post-processing capabilities and the application of large language models.",
    "text": "One interesting thing is that the cost of compute, or rather the amount of compute that will be available is only going to go up. So being able to take advantage of that compute and do lots and lots of processing or post-processing does seem extremely relevant to me, especially as architectures continue to evolve on the hardware side is, assuming we can support something like this and do massively parallel inference, being able to do a lot of parallel post-processing via large language models seems very reasonably done and probably fairly important as well."

    "title": "\"Advancing Parallel Processing and Transformations for Enhanced Model Execution\"",
    "summary": "In the first bucket, the focus is on achieving AI-level parallelism, creating a better pipeline, enabling the execution of different LLM tasks in parallel, and allowing future agents to add information to an execution graph. This parallelization is crucial for distributed systems processing and likely to advance the distribution and parallel running of models. The second bucket involves implementing transformations, such as converting unstructured transcripts into organized bullet point lists, and making this adaptable and viable through JSON. The goal is to seamlessly convert text into a GitHub issue, providing instructions for transformation and capturing context to refine models.",
    "text": "My previous recording didn't work, so here we are. Gonna simplify my thinking into two buckets, one being AI-level parallelism, basically wanting a better pipeline, and to be able to execute different LLM tasks in parallel, as well as being able to have agents in the future be able to add information to an execution graph. To be able to parallelize that, and that will be very important for distributed systems kind of processing, I believe. I think there's probably gonna be significant advances in how we distribute these models and can run them in parallel. So that seems like an important thing to be able to do from the software side, is getting infrastructure ready to be able to run things in parallel. Execute much faster, basically. And that could come down to hardware level or even network level. I think both need to be covered. The second bucket is transformations and wanting to add some kind of transformation to data on the webpage. For example, turning some unstructured transcript into a bullet point list. I think that makes a lot of sense, and that should be safe to JSON and all of these things, but that's more or less it. I may even want to take this text, for example, and turn it directly into a GitHub issue. As I'm thinking about this, and I really just want it to be like, okay, this thing right here, I know what it is. The agent actually doesn't even need to know what it is immediately. That would be a nice step, but I know it needs to be a GitHub issue, so I'd love to just be able to basically write, turn this into a GitHub issue. Turn bucket two into a GitHub issue, because I could read the transcript and figure out what needs to be done, and I could skim it and get that information. I'm actually not trying to solve the bigger problem yet, because that doesn't matter, and we can effectively capture that context and get the training data as a result of my actions and transformations that I want to make on the data. That gives the model a much better idea of what kinds of things I want to be doing on my data, and that can be used to fine-tune models, I believe."

    "summary": "NVIDIA has historically excelled in developing software tailored to its hardware, which has been pivotal to its success and influence in the AI industry, much of which can be attributed to its proprietary CUDA technology. The importance of software in enhancing hardware capabilities is highlighted, prompting a reflection on the potential of working with open-source libraries like llama.cpp to further accelerate hardware performance. The writer expresses a willingness to operate at the intersection of software and hardware, an area they find intriguing, especially with tasks like memory management and massively parallel processing on machine learning inference cards. This convergence of software and hardware is not only a subject of professional interest for the author but also recognized as an area of important technological development.",
    "text": "It's interesting that NVIDIA's trend throughout its history has been making very excellent software for its hardware, as in initially bringing drivers in house, according to Asianometry. And how, I mean, if we look forward to today, how them being able to focus on software for their hardware has enabled them to be as big of a company as they are, and to be a force in the AI industry is only because of their drivers. At the end of the day, it's because of CUDA. So it's interesting to see how important software is for hardware. And yeah, I mean, it just makes me think maybe I need to look at llama.cpp and all of these open source libraries to accelerate hardware, as well as maybe there's some frameworks that still need help. And what ways can we accelerate them? Because I don't mind being on the boundary of software and hardware. I worked on that boundary already, effectively firmware, or right above firmware, and I can be comfortable in that place. And managing memory and all of that is, it's an interesting thing. And to work on something massively parallel, like a machine learning inference card, would be fascinating and also quite important, I think. So that's a fun little tangent, I guess, of possibilities."
