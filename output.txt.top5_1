GENERATED CODE COMPLETION:
 The question asks for "top 5 areas," which implies a ranking or frequency analysis. However, since your instructions prohibit searching within title, summary, or text fields for any words or phrases, and there is no explicit information given on what "top" means or any other fields to infer this from, it's not possible to determine "areas" of thought or their ranking based solely on the provided `Document` type structure.

Given the constraints and the fact that no other fields are provided that could indirectly indicate areas of thought or interest, the only operation we could possibly do is return the data as is because the question cannot be addressed with the current rules and data structure.

So, the answer here will be simply the `data`, as we can't infer "areas" without additional context or access to restricted fields like `title` or `text`.

    summary: "The speaker describes a space for cherishing meaningful ideas and thoughts that they find intriguing, rather than documenting their everyday activities and opinions. They view this space as an experimental platform for exploring and developing new ways of thinking and understanding the world. It's intended as a reserved area for considering and refining significant concepts.",

    summary: "The speaker discusses the importance of attention span and the need to step back from constantly focusing on devices, like smartphones and computer screens. They ponder the possibility of returning to a broader, more immersive experience of the world and whether emerging technologies, like wearable computer screens, could help rekindle curiosity and expand attention spans. There's a focus on the potential for integrating these technologies to enhance real-time exploration and engagement with the world. Ultimately, the speaker expresses curiosity about the impact of these developments on attention span and the appreciation of the world around us.",
    text: "Bezos is also talking about the importance of attention span, effectively. At least, that's my pretty bad interpretation of what he's saying. However, I also find it important, and I wonder if... What ways we can come back into a broader vision and scope of reality. That is, getting away from the pocket rock, us staring at pocket rock. And back into experiencing the world more fully. And same thing is the computer screen. We just miniaturized it. I guess we're going to slap it on our faces here quite soon. But I wonder in the implementation of slapping it on our face, whether that affords us the opportunity to bring back the attention span in some ways. And highlight the curiosities of the world in real time. Yeah, that's what I'm super, super curious about."

    title: "\"Enhancing Embeddings: Exploring Alternative Approaches for Improved Search and Analysis\"",
    summary: "Some people are realizing that embeddings alone are insufficient, and they are proposing different approaches to address this issue. A few suggestions include converting queries into keywords and conducting searches based on them, utilizing indexed full-text search databases, incorporating knowledge graphs, and implementing named entity recognition and traditional pair extraction techniques. A hybrid approach that combines all of these methods may be necessary to effectively tackle the limitations of using embeddings alone.",
    text: "So, it seems like people are also realizing embeddings are not enough. However, there are some approaches people are suggesting. One is, um, for queries, transferring a question into keywords, and then searching based on those. Having an indexed full-text search database. No idea what that looks like yet. Um, knowledge graphs. And also... Uh, something like named entity recognition, and also just more traditional pair extraction from a piece of text, like NLP-type stuff. And I think a hybrid approach of all these is probably going to be needed."

The prospect of tomorrow brings a sense of promise, hinting at the potential for new beginnings and the excitement of storytelling.",
    text: "I'm always looking to be around more smart and interesting people who really care about what they do and are not just going through the motions all the time. Yeah, I guess being in computing is like a passion and I want to be around people who are passionate about it. I think the same goes for many of the things that I'm into, surfing or climbing. I want to be around those passionate people in those sports, the people who are psyched about it because I also want to be psyched about it. I don't want to just be like, oh yeah, it's okay. I just do that thing. No, I want to be stoked and yeah, I want to be stoked about like every aspect of my life. So I do want to surround myself with more of those stoked people and yeah, just in every aspect of life. And I can't wait to hopefully have a moment of a breather at least for a little bit tomorrow and maybe go climb or slackline or something and look forward to the weekend where I can maybe take a breather as well and still have plenty of time to think and do a bit of a reset and figure out where I'm at and how I want to move forward and evaluate what I have. And yeah, I don't know if I'll have demo, quote unquote, tomorrow, but I'm feeling the promise right now and feeling the promise may be enough to begin to tell a story and that's exciting. So maybe there is some potential."

    title: "\"Harnessing Energy for Effective Website Development\"",
    summary: "I am feeling energetic and plan to channel this into meditation before starting work to effectively implement my ideas. It's crucial for me to detach the mental process from the technical aspect of building a website, as the conflation of both is overwhelming. Although perfection is unattainable at this stage, and low-level functionality may remain complex, this approach will facilitate the identification of components that need abstraction. Moreover, it will help distinguish between the user interface and the core system functions.",
    text: "I have so much energy coursing through my body right now. I'm going to meditate before I get into work and trying to put trying to put some of these ideas into practice with what I've written already. Not just staying out an idea land, but trying to implement them and getting base level viability out there. I think it needs to be done. I really need to be able to separate out the brain component from building a website. I think that is absolutely critical because it's driving me insane right now trying to do that already but beyond that I think it'll make it much easier for other people to use. And it won't be perfect. Some of the low-level functionality is probably going to stay within the brain for now and it's going to be kind of a pain to work with. But that'll help us discover what are the things that do need to be abstracted. And what separates user space from kernel land in some way as well."

Yeah. So... That's... That's the main one, I think. And also, on a different note, learning how to be back in tune with reality. Kind of not living in fantasy world for a little bit, maybe. Or figuring out how to make the real world fantasy world. What is the world that I wish to be in, and trying to make that a better place. Learning what that world is, and actually trying to create it in some sense. The cyborg future is interesting."

    summary: "The author emphasizes the need for personal AI to be holistic and know a fair bit about the user to answer complex questions. They express skepticism about current devices like Tab and Rewind catching on but foresee their eventual adoption. They ponder the societal implications of pervasive surveillance and advocate for thoughtful consideration. The author envisions using an AI system to capture and analyze their conversations at home to elucidate thinking patterns and make them accessible. Additionally, they discuss the limitations of vector algorithms in representing complex questions and suggest the need for a new approach.\n\nThe speaker suggests that while their idea is a starting point, further exploration is necessary to determine its relevance and significance. They reflect on the process of developing a deeper understanding and consider the practical aspects of implementing their thoughts about how the brain is constructed.",
    text: "One other thing that I wish to mention is I think personal AI is going to have to be quite holistic. And I think I mentioned this previously, but I want to emphasize it in this message. That for the computer to be able to answer these more complex questions, it does need to know a fair bit about me. I think that will probably happen again inevitably. I think we are seeing people push that direction with devices like Tab and Rewind and all of this. I think that these things are a bit too early personally. I find the concept very interesting, but I cannot see it catching on at this moment. However, I do believe that it will catch on at some point. Whether that is a society we want to have or not is a different question. But I also think that there is possibility to influence that society, even if it is inevitable. In what ways do we wish to allow ourselves to be seen to others? I guess that is probably an open question and something that can be pushed on. It does not need to be just like everyone is surveilled all the time. It does not necessarily need to be that. I think that this is a broader thing that is happening in the world that is worthwhile to think about. And to not get, at least for me, too sad about. It is something that can be done thoughtfully and probably should be done thoughtfully. So, yes. Basically what I was saying is that this does need to be holistic. Listening at some point probably will be a thing. I am speaking into this thing right now. I wish to have something like this in my home and I will build that. I do wish to record what I am saying in my home. Maybe not all the time. But I find that good conversations happen at home. And to be able to have that in some kind of second brain could elucidate some of my patterns of thinking. And put some of those patterns out into the world, hopefully. In some way that is what I am doing right now by speaking into this. That I wish that I can look at these patterns at a broader level. Have bullet points of what they are and be able to dive into each of those bullet points. And that can be done very loosely. It does not need to be hyper-organized like a file system. The brain is the new file system. You can kind of just dump whatever the fuck you want in there and know you can retrieve it later. Yes, maybe there is still some hierarchy and stuff just because it is useful. It does not mean throw everything completely out. We can leverage the existing things that we have to make this new thing even better. It is not just a vector database. That is not enough. We need some kind of log whether that log be in a database or some other form. It is needed so we can look through time. And also be able to quickly access relevant information that may not be specifically related to vectors. Vectors give us an intuition. Let me say that again. Vectors give us an intuition. They get us in the ballpark and the neighborhood. But that may not always be enough. A sufficiently complex question will be in multiple neighborhoods. And that will be hard, I believe, to represent in vector space in a single question. Maybe it gets close enough. But from the vector algorithms that I have seen so far, it often does not get close enough. Maybe that is the performance of the one that we are using. There are others. This is something to be evaluated, but it gets you in the ballpark. So after you get in the ballpark, you need to do more to figure out what is actually salient and relevant to that question. Anyhow, this is me thinking about out loud about more implementation level details of how the brain would get made."

    title: "\"Reimagining TRIPS: Web Rings, Japan, and a Digital Album\"",
    summary: "The speaker is contemplating revisiting their previous TRIPS project, considering the innovative idea of transforming extensive data on Japan into an interactive web experience or ‘brain thing’, which would serve as a digital album. They express a desire to work with an individual named Chandler to utilize their collected photographs, stories, and voice notes from Japan to create a website powered by natural language queries. Additionally, the speaker reflects on the potential resurgence of web rings as a means to foster unique internet communities that appreciate diversity, suggesting these could be structured through natural language. The speaker believes that these ideas, including the reincorporation of web rings and the Japan project, form a coherent vision that can be communicated to others, and they plan to record these thoughts for future reference.",
    text: "Another aspect of this is me just basically rethinking about the TRIPS project that I had in the past. And one thing that I'm very keen on to experiment with is, well, to figure out how to get all of the data that I have on Japan into a web page or a brain thing and basically use that as the album. That is the media artifact. And right now, maybe that is its own separate thing. But overall, eventually, that should be part of the same network. But we can experiment with it in a little form. And basically, I would love to work with Chandler to take our Japan photos, our Japan stories, and our Japan voice notes and see what little website we can build out of that just through natural language queries. I feel like that would be quite fascinating in a lot of aspects. So these are the main three things that I'm talking about. And the other one was, I mean, I mentioned it in the first note that I recorded. But again, web rings. I think web rings are basically ripe. There is a certain kind of hunger for it. And a getting away from the global village and being like, OK, well, how do we form communities in a different kind of way? How do we create internet spaces very easily? And internet spaces that are diverse, that show our diversity. And I do believe that possibly that can be done just straight up through natural language. And in some sense, these things that I said form, I believe, a coherent enough vision for someone else to understand. So that is a possibility. I'm going to note it down here. But I believe that some of these notes maybe at least push in a more concrete direction."

The article suggests that models like Mamba, which employ state space techniques, may offer potential avenues for this approach.",
    text: "The bitter lesson that Raphael linked me to is really good and in some sense is pointing at my approach of like you know doing all kinds of like feature extraction and everything on top to kind of get somewhere. But also yeah I do kind of agree that like basically the point is computation is ever expanding and as a result of that computation we can do way more. And that's fascinating and yeah seems very very very true. And something to definitely keep in of basically just yeah kind of saying throw more compute at the problem and see where we get from there in terms of contextual AI. And I guess maybe that maybe that is possible and then figuring out ways that do that. Maybe these state space models like Mamba are a way of doing this. I want to play with them."

Um, what I wish to see might be fun just to do as like a little thing. And I could probably just talk it out and then edit together, get together something and call it a day.

The company's mission is to facilitate the easy linkage of data, unleashing significant value for individuals and communities. Furthermore, the future likely holds a variety of new social media platforms created by individual communities, enabled by deeper connected information, though the specific nature of these developments remains uncertain.",
    text: "Part of the thesis is around data, right? Actually, data is core to the thesis. And one thing about it I want to note down is it should be obvious to an investor that data is extremely valuable. And beyond that, if we had better connections between our data, that only makes the data even more valuable. This should not be something that needs to be explained, in my opinion. I think it is obvious. And if you do not see it as obvious, you probably should not be investing. I think this is an obvious thing to see. And by unlocking it, you should understand inherently that it is extraordinarily valuable. And our quest as a company is to make the connections between data as easy to use as possible. That is the quest. Because if we can unlock that, we can unlock an extraordinary amount of value for ourselves as people, as well as our communities. And that is what we are trying to do. I want to see much greater expression in the world. Expression not contained to existing social media platforms. And I believe it will be very, very, very possible for many social media platforms to exist. They are effectively media formats right now. But are they the only media formats that work? Absolutely not. I suspect that individual communities will come up with new ways of creating media formats for their community. It's hard to understand what that even means right now. But with much deeper connected information, I think it will become very obvious. This is just my intuition. But I feel like it must be the case. I cannot see how it is not the case. What that will look like again is completely unknown. We're not there yet."

Recognizing the inevitability of change in technology, they prefer not to commit to a single form factor, instead aiming to create a flexible space that supports a wide array of experiments and inputs. Their vision is to foster an environment that accommodates continuous innovation and supports everyone, without being limited by current design paradigms.",

I think Avi and Tab and the Humane thing and all of this is our first ditch attempt at making a system like this. But what I think is, well, I want to build the underlying infrastructure that makes those things possible. At the end of the day, those things are input methods. And I want to be able to support a broad range of input methods and hopefully in a very relatively small API space. The kernel for your personal data. And just like we have IO devices and things like that in computers, now this is extending it to our bodies and our senses. And I think that that definitely will need to be covered and probably can be covered quite simply. And it'll take experimentation to get there, but I think we can do it. And given that, yeah, where I want to play is, I want to support everything and everyone. I don't need to take a strong opinion on what the form factor is going to be right now, because it will change in six months. It will change in a year and a half. I would rather create the space that affords many different experiments to evolve and not get sucked into one or the other. And that is part of what I would like to create."

    title: "\"Unlocking the Potential of Compute Resources for Post-Processing and Language Models\"",
    summary: "The cost of computing power is expected to decrease, leading to increased availability. This makes the ability to utilize this computing power for extensive processing or post-processing very important, especially with evolving hardware architectures. If supported, doing massively parallel inference and leveraging large language models for parallel post-processing will likely be both feasible and significant. The trend towards more accessible compute resources will thus play a pivotal role in the advancement of post-processing capabilities and the application of large language models.",
    text: "One interesting thing is that the cost of compute, or rather the amount of compute that will be available is only going to go up. So being able to take advantage of that compute and do lots and lots of processing or post-processing does seem extremely relevant to me, especially as architectures continue to evolve on the hardware side is, assuming we can support something like this and do massively parallel inference, being able to do a lot of parallel post-processing via large language models seems very reasonably done and probably fairly important as well."

    summary: "The speaker is pondering whether market efficiency could benefit from restructuring, speculating about specialization and the formation of numerous smaller, highly focused companies. They note an anecdote from Chandler about underutilization at work, suggesting that technological advances have outpaced job functions, leading to wasted potential and the possibility that better time utilization could lead to happier employees and less intense work environments. The speaker questions the need for large companies to conduct all operations internally, proposing that concentrated capital expenditures might be more effective, and uses TSMC as an example while also acknowledging the possibility that their ideas might not be valid. Overall, the speaker is curious about the potential for market disruption through a reimagined corporate structure and is seeking to view the market through this new perspective.",
    text: "I wonder if we're ready for a more efficient market and I wonder if that means redetermining what the market looks like in some way to, um, I don't know exactly what I'm trying to say here. And I think probably realistically, the issue is so complex that it's hard to encapsulate in such a tiny thought, um, is probably the reality, but my, my main point being here is I wonder if it makes sense to actually specialize to a higher degree in some way and having lots of smaller, more focused, um, kind of companies, you know, maxing out at like maybe 500 people or something. And part of this is just talking with Chandler and, you know, him being like, well, we have nothing to do. Like I could do my job in an hour. And I think that shows that the rate of technology growth has been fantastic. And it also means that, well, we don't want to, like, basically we want people to have jobs, but we also don't want them doing nothing like we want to utilize their time effectively. And I think by utilizing time effectively, you have happier people. Um, and you also can work less in some ways. Like I don't think every company needs to be peddled to the metal. I think there will be companies that do that and probably they are important. And, um, in the markets that they compete in, it may be necessary to do so. For example, like TSMC, however, yeah, like I, I basically just wanted to wonder what is, what is a strategy for, um, disruption of, of large companies? Like I, in, in some ways, like again, using TSMC as an example, well, maybe not everything needs to be done in house. Um, and maybe that capex can actually be, um, more concentrated in some way. Like one company who does massive capital expenditures in a very sophisticated place. Um, I guess Illumina is probably maybe one example of this, but they are quite huge. Um, I don't know. It, it, I'm just curious and I want to look at the market through this lens a bit and see if what I'm saying even makes any sense at all, because it's quite possible that it absolutely is just garbage thinking."

    summary: "Language models should prioritize visual components because human interaction with the world is primarily visual. While auditory understanding is important, the ability to describe the world visually for both sighted and visually impaired individuals is crucial. Visual representations of data are highly valuable and likely to remain essential in AI assistant systems. Therefore, incorporating visualizations into these systems should be a foundational consideration.",
    text: "One thing I think is very important for language model based systems is that they still must be visual at the end of the day. Like, well, why I say this specifically is that the way I interact with the world is primarily visual. I do think auditory is very important, but even in the sense of being able to describe the world visually for blind folks, as well as for people with sight, being able to see visualizations of information. Visualizations of information are extremely important, in my opinion, and I suspect that those navigational structures are not going to go away in a pure AI assistant kind of thing. Like, it does need to bring up visualizations on the fly. That is one of the things that it needs to do, and that needs to be fundamentally supported at the base level, I believe."

    text: "Just a note on, at least for me, one thing I am looking for, which is the defragmentation of my data. And by having this AI agent effectively in so many arenas, whether it be my Spotify data, my iCloud data, my photos that are going in there, iMessages that I'm sending to my friends, you know, my calendar. All of these things, voice notes, whatever, I think giving this brain that much context probably enables it to... Probably enables it to, I guess, understand you and things and what you want much better. Maybe this is me just being a little bit too crazy and fucking out there, but I fucking hate fragmentation of data. It drives me insane. I wish I had better control of my data because if I could ask it more questions, it would be way more useful to me in the sense that also from a business perspective, well, if I had an aggregate of my data somewhere. Now, if other people want to ask me questions on that data, over that data set, they can have their individual slice of the data if they're producing it. But what if you want to ask bigger questions, questions in aggregate of that data? It needs to be stored somewhere centrally to be able to do that effectively. And the fact that we do not have that is a massive problem for learning, generally speaking. And those learnings and insights, I suspect, could be used for business as well. This is a whole bigger question. I don't know if what I'm saying here makes sense, like, cognitively. I don't really know exactly what I'm saying here, but it is something that I wish to develop further."

And what exactly that first system is and what makes money, I'm a bit unclear on. But I also think it's possible to get money to do some of the groundwork. And yeah, I will see kind of where it goes. I'm not really attached to do local large language model stuff, though I want to in the future. I definitely am curious about what kind of questions are going to come up when I start experimenting with the data that I have so far and kind of go from there. And if I'm going to be able to piece together thinking or not. And maybe getting back to brain twin and the group nature brain thing and trying to figure out how best to introspect into that system. Yeah, I guess that's something interesting to me. Obviously, brain twin in its current form is not really being used in a group setting.

And the second part is trying to figure out some kind of social mechanism for putting this information out there. Like the things that I'm saying, like thinking how I wish to consume this information, because I would like this kind of information coming towards me. If John has one of these, again, I really would like to have that feed that is algorithmically, in some way, very related to things that I care about. And that the things that I care about, other people can get some insights in. And again, partially making that very visible up front by just what I'm saying, like putting that on a webpage. Here are the things that I'm interested in right now, and historically, what I have been interested in, based on my actions, as well as what I'm saying. And then I also would love to be able to consume that from other people, and to some degree, have it less of a show, not like trying to show off, like this is what I'm doing and what I'm thinking, but like a bit more objectively of this is what I'm thinking, and this is what I've been doing. At least in the sense, I'm having to record audio and do it. I guess I could write the same things, and yeah. But for me, I guess maybe that's just not the medium that I wish to operate in.

The speaker also considers implementing a depth limit to control the potential recursive impact of these modules on each other in the brain. Overall, the discussion serves as an overview of the speaker's current thoughts and an opportunity to test recent cleanup efforts.",
    text: "I am in the process of thinking about a module system for the brain. That is, right now we have effectively one, well, we'll call it two modules of different hierarchies or orders. The first module is the audio file handler. That is, when we submit an audio file, some things happen as a result of that. The module that we run on top of it, well, I guess there's a couple, potentially, that we run on top of it. One is the summarization module. Just to get a summary of that audio, something really simple, concise, and lets you glance at it. That's as simple as it is for now. But in the future, it's possible that people will want to implement their own modules. Right now, it won't go that far as to have other people implement their own modules, but it will make my process of writing new modules much easier, and from there, we can begin to think about how others may implement them in the future. But given this, to make the process easier, I have two suggested modules that I'm curious about. The first is a module called questions. Questions is a module that takes the text and tries to extract any salient questions from it. This module may be extended in the future, but for now, that's all it will try and do, is make a list of questions. Maybe in JSON format, maybe not. Who knows? For now, it's a first attempt. So that's one module I'd like to add. There's another module that I'd like to add, which is another kind of feature extraction module, which is like what the questions is. It's extracting questions from the thing. And it may return nothing as well, and that's totally okay. The second one is a feature extraction module called people. We want to extract names and people from the text. This probably will come in very handy in the future. Exactly what that looks like right now, don't know. But I can imagine queries of that being very relevant. And that can be with inside the data or not. And perhaps even there's an entire higher order module called people that this attends to, that the brain is aware of all of the other modules that may be impacted as a result of something going in. And likely, because these modules are all aware of each other, we have to set some recursive depth limit on all of them. That is if they are constantly updating each other in result, what is to stop that going on for infinity? That is precisely the problem. We will probably limit it to three. Depth of three. Or four or five or something. Something fairly low. So it impacts the modules that are primary first. And anyhow, yes, this is just an overview of kind of what I am thinking. And it's also partially a test to make sure the cleanup that I did works nicely."

    text: "And I guess beyond all of the most basic aspects of the brain and the personal AI thing, something that I want to note too is that it effectively becomes an application platform. And what I mean by that is one of the things that I might want to ask it is, hey, can you plan what activities I'm going to do this week? And for me, thinking about it from a technology perspective, I need the brain now to do some extra things that it maybe wasn't doing before. Specifically, thinking about feature extraction and metadata extraction from text or whatever forms, images, whatever. And it should know through that feature extraction, okay, CJ is a climber or CJ likes to surf, CJ likes to slackline, X, Y, and Z. And then be able to do maybe some reaching out to the internet for weather and surf conditions. And maybe if there's interoperability with my friends, their brains, and whatever they're willing to share with me, that it looks at their schedules to some degree and can be like, okay, here's a proposal, CJ, for what your week might look like. Surf at Monday at Ocean Beach because the conditions are looking really good, X, Y, and Z, it's like this. And then maybe on Tuesday, go climb with Patrick because Patrick is free and he wants to go climb Mount Woodson. And maybe on Wednesday, go surf again, the swell has died out a little bit, but it's perfect conditions at Swami's, blah, blah, blah. Whatever, Thursday, go slackline, the weather is going to be terrible for surfing and no one's available to be a climbing partner and then whatever else. And then it's like, for the weekend, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Anyway, I think we've talked about, you probably don't want your entire life to be driven by this thing, but there are aspects of life that are nice to absolve. I do spend a lot of time looking at surf cameras and weather and surf reports and blah, blah, blah. I do spend a fair amount of time doing all of that and it's okay, but it doesn't always feel like I really want to be spending my time doing that. Anyhow, I literally have like 70 to 100 questions written down that do this, but my main point, the main point I was saying in all of this is that this is an application platform and the question that I just described is effectively like a little brain module. And it should not be up to me or anyone to create all of those brain modules. That is an insane task. And maybe the brains get better and better, but over time, I think the biggest thing is that anyone should have the ability and the tools at their hands to be able to create and compose these modules that make it effective for their lives. And in whatever way that means, but that is really like what I'm curious about in some way. And beyond that, when talking about other people's brains, now we can start communicating between them. That is a protocol. And personally, I want this to be a better friend. Like I am not always the best of friends because my brain just doesn't remember people all the time. It's not always good at that. And I do wish to make that process easier. And maybe all of that's a farce. Maybe I just need to work on that myself. But regardless, there are things here that I think are probably genuinely useful and can be used for personal growth."

And, you know, I guess that's something that I'll write down on my questions list. So let me do that real fast. Right. So I guess the point of this message, in some way, is I'm trying to do the darn thing. And I don't want to be afraid to put out half-baked work. As in, it does actually work. It's not perfect. But I also want to have a call to action to be like, if we do this together, it will be a better world. And I don't need to hide behind doing things behind closed doors and seeing that demos may or may not be real. I've built many demos in my life. I know how easy it is to potentially impress someone with a demo. But behind the scenes, you know, it's the Homer Simpson-like meme with his back clipped together so he looks super sexy. Like, no. I'm tired of doing that. I'm tired of doing that. And I'm actively trying to write code in such a way where it is not doing that and also write calls to large language models where it's not doing that. And I'm also not perfect. Like, what I just described is an agential system. To do that correctly is an agential system. And I do not have the right understanding to build a very effective agential system right now. I don't. But I do believe that is generally the direction we are going. And that is the direction we should be going. And how do we get there? And how do we begin to process large amounts of data to put it in the right format? How do we connect data sources to each other? Those are all open and important questions to form an overall better context of who we are. And I would love to say just like shoving all the documents into RAG and pulling out the top five is going to work. But like, I just don't know how that's going to fucking work. It's just not enough context about someone. I can't fit my context in five documents unless those documents are perfect documents. And maybe through large language models we can start generating more perfect documents for them."

    text: "Overall, I think these last submissions that I've talked about are powerful. And with Tanaki as the muser, I think can come into reality in a very meaningful way. I don't want to be interacting with just GPT personally. Some people might, but that's not what I want. I think a lot of the brain that I have described, we have seen people take it in a business direction. Upload all of your company's documents to this thing and now you have an amazing knowledge base. That's great, but that does not apply to me in any meaningful way. The questions that I am going to ask are very different than the questions a business will ask. And I do truly believe that more of the power of these tools that we have is in the hands of individuals and people than it is in the hands of corporations. I think it will still make tons of money in corporations. I have no doubt about that. But I really do believe that in the hands of people, this technology has the potential to change the world dramatically for the better. It will change the world no matter what. But I think if we can provide people amazing tools for themselves and for their friends, that is an extremely positive thing. And on the silicon point that I am talking about, I want to do a little bit of research to make sure this is accurate. But given the fact that we can already run large language models on an iPhone, that is a possibility we can do it. I suspect that in a few years time, we will likely get GPT 3.5 or GPT 4 level performance being able to run on a mobile device. That is an interesting concept in and of itself. I think that this has the ability to profoundly change how we interact with computers. I think it has profound impact on how we interact with information generally speaking. What does the internet look like when you have something that has that capability? Also, it reminds me a bit of early computing. I could be entirely off base here. I tend to be extremely optimistic about local compute. So that is my bias. But early computers were mainframes. They were not for the individual. They were not for the individual. They were for companies and we had terminals to access them. In a large way, we have gone back to that because that has been what is most profitable at this moment. But the democratization of this kind of compute, I believe, will come to everyone. It is inevitable that it will come to everyone. And I would rather be on that curve. And given that possibility, I think we will not always need to rely on open AI. It is very possible that businesses will rely on open AI just like they rely on IBM to this day. Open AI is not going away. But the kinds of data that businesses are doing is a lot different than the kinds of data that I am doing. The scale of that is entirely different. So the scale of compute required is also entirely different. This is to say, I really believe in this direction going forward. And I think it has the possibility to bring a lot of value. Even though right now it looks a bit gloomy in some way. It is for nerds."

    title: "\"The Secure Second Brain: Modules, Introspection, and Interoperability\"",
    summary: "The main points discussed in the text are the concept of a secure second brain for storing and sharing information, the importance of creating modular and composable systems for higher order modules and abstractions, the need for brain introspection tools to interact with and inspect the stored information, and the idea of interoperability to facilitate communication and collaboration between different brains. Additionally, there is a mention of potential open source offerings and hosted options for running the system, as well as the possibility of developing hardware to make self-running more feasible in the future.",
    text: "So to kind of summarize all of the things that I've been talking about in some kind of, I guess, I was using them in concrete kind of questions and applications that I could see. I kind of want to step back and what are the the overall overarching things maybe. And I think the first thing is a secure second brain. What exactly what that means, I am not sure. But I believe in all of those words in some way. I believe that it is important that this is not just open fully to the public. I don't want my brain just leaking everywhere. There are parts of my brain that I am super happy to leak. In fact, I'm probably happier than most people to leak a lot of it. Leak is not really the right word either. It's really share. But there's also a bunch of things that I don't necessarily want to share. I'm not comfortable sharing it. So that's, that's one piece. And I think in that the thing is, is having modules and basically having it have some level of composability in and of itself. So people can build these higher order modules, figuring out what those abstractions are. And I think through musering Tanaki and Pascal throwing out tons of ideas, we get a sense of what it may be like to build those abstractions. So we don't have to build specific implementations every time, but we have a generic implementation that can be used for many, many things. That I think is valuable. And if those abstractions can be provided to more people, I think people will pay for that. The second piece is kind of the piece in some way that we're starting to move into slowly, which is brain introspection tools is this brain is nice, but without any way to look at it in a variety of ways, you don't really get a sense of how to interact with it. And it probably will become natural at some point, but the first iterations may look like a website, a dashboard, what is salient to you? This is very generic and broad and is probably incorrect. But I'm just throwing it out there as we will probably want that this as researchers to be able to introspect and poke at it. And then, as a person, I also want it for some of the questions that I've begun to ask, even for Dr. Lingenberry, I would be curious, who are the people that Dr. Lingen knows about? That's that question itself is completely related to, like my life as well. What does it know about my friends? That is, that is super fucking relevant. So anyhow, yes. And then the last little piece is the interoperability that I talked about is it should be able to talk to other people's brains. And in fact, create group brains and all of this kind of thing, creating protocols to do that. I mean, exactly how this is implemented, I am not sure. I think that there should be open source offerings where you can choose to run this yourself. And there also maybe is a hosted option where you don't want to run it because that's a fucking pain. But I also think that it's worth maybe eventually building hardware that makes it really easy to run yourself. And right now that might not be feasible. But in five years, the silicon is going to be available where it will be very easy to do that. Or I believe that the silicon will be there. I could be wrong, but I follow the industry quite closely."

I wish to see more perspectives and at least acknowledge why someone chooses to live the way they do and breed understanding in the world. Even though my opinion may differ, it doesn't make someone's experience any less. I personally want to grow in that direction and I also want to see more of it in the world, generally speaking. I think we do see it all over the place already, but more understanding is better. Also to say it's obvious there's a fair amount of division as well.

Because I love speculating about futures, I guess. And wanting to bring certain ones of them into reality. And believing that those are good bets. One of the things that I do wonder is if these large language models are going to be run locally on devices.

    summary: "I've realized that I don't need immediate answers and having a progress update by Friday, such as a screenshot, will suffice to indicate we're on track. By Friday, if we haven't achieved this, we'll need to reassess our progress and consider whether we are closer to our goal. The possible expansion to different data sources is a concern, and I'm contemplating an 'agential' architecture where agents manage different types of data. To effectively answer questions with available data, we might use a system that assembles JSON objects, but how to handle various embedding spaces for different data types like audio or text remains uncertain.",
    text: "One thing that I just realized for myself is I don't need to have the answer to the question today. And if I could have the answer to the question by Friday, my original goal, that would be good enough. I don't need to have an MVP by Friday. I just want to have a screenshot by Friday. If I can have that, then I think we are moving towards something. If by Friday we do not have it, then that's a different issue. I guess at that point, we have to reevaluate based on where we're at. Are we any closer? Are we in the same place? And this is even before extending out data sources, which is something I'm mildly concerned about, how to make that really good and possible. I think given the framework and structure of what I have currently, it should be possible if we can answer the questions in this context, but it also may not be. And that is something that I'm going to have to think about and probably contend with in some way. And perhaps this is where I need to think about some agential type architecture where we kind of have agents for effectively kinds of data or something like that. I'm not sure. Where if you need to collect or collate some data, basically they are the ones containing the knowledge of the structures, something to that degree. Basically, how would you access those kind of pieces of information? And again, maybe the pipeline of assembling JSON objects is kind of the way that you do that, of like, okay, if I had this JSON object and I had that JSON object, I can answer this question effectively. Maybe that's a way of going about it. And maybe that's something to try in the sense like having an audio retriever and what data is embedded, what those embeddings mean, you know, blah, blah, blah. And maybe that's the same for, say, text messages or journals or whatever. Maybe those are in the same embedding spaces or maybe they're in different embedding spaces. That I'm not quite sure about yet. I suspect sometimes you'll want them to be in the same embedding space and I suspect other times you will not. So this is just like my first little attempt at thinking about this."

    title: "\"Meaningful Business: Navigating Challenges and Focusing on the Big Picture\"",
    summary: "Jeff Bezos discusses the importance of focusing on the \"big things\" in business rather than being overwhelmed by the \"paper cuts,\" or small issues that can accumulate and harm a company. He emphasizes the need to identify what will not change in the long term and to address ongoing challenges, such as the impact of technology on society and the need for meaningful connections and self-expression. Bezos also highlights the significance of nurturing curiosity and creativity to navigate the evolving world effectively. Ultimately, he suggests that striving to make life more meaningful and purposeful is a timeless and universal challenge facing everyone.\n\nThe text highlights the desire to make life more meaningful, referencing the Industrial Revolution as an effort to improve the quality of life and allow for more time for other activities. However, it questions whether this goal has been achieved. It also suggests that the potential for meaning already exists and needs to be discovered, recognized, and acknowledged through recognizing the interconnectedness of everything, including the oneness of all things. Additionally, it discusses the parallel between this search for meaning and the extraction of features in computers, implying that the process of manually extracting meaning can eventually be displayed in a user-friendly interface.\n\nSpurvis is focused on training data and storing files, and they are considering adding support for videos and photos. They plan to initially store this data with a simple setup and later make it relational and queryable. Additionally, they intend to build a separate frontend client, and they are considering the public accessibility of the content they will add. They also mention the need to figure out how messages will work when added and plan to make a note about it in their notebook.",
    text: "I'm listening to Jeff Bezos on the Lex Friedman podcast. And one of the things that I find very fascinating is something that Jeff just said in this podcast, which is basically this idea between the big things and paper cuts. And the paper cuts are like all of the small things that, you know, customers don't like effectively. And there is death by a thousand paper cuts. And so that is definitely something to avoid. But it also makes me think that's not something that runs the business. And it is something that makes the business continue to be the best it can be. But it seems like the question of what are the big things, he mentions, are what is not going to change in ten years from today? And for me, in the industry that I'm in, and that I enjoy, is, well, to me, it doesn't seem like computers are going to slow down. And that's one thing. But that doesn't impact people. Directly. Indirectly, it has a million knock-on effects. But in terms of how to make life better, maybe is identifying some of the ways in which, I guess, there is pain or suffering. And being able to identify those and work through those. For me, one of the things that I care about the most, and that I struggle with the most, especially when it comes to, you know, the things that I do, and that I struggle with the most, especially when I'm single or going through a change in life, is, you know, connecting with friends. And also just generally being able to express myself. I think those are two things that are not going to be any easier. Well, they're going to be a problem in 10 years, and they're going to be a problem today. Expressing self is an ongoing process. There's also another, which is creativity. Or curiosity, rather. I think that that's something I wish to encourage. But this does not have... I mean, moving into the world that we are, I think curiosity is going to need to be heightened. And honestly, as I look into the world, I do kind of see it. And I don't think it is restricted just to the weirdos that I hang around, quite frankly. And I love my weirdos. I say that only in the most loving way. And... Yeah, what did I say the other day? The other day is meaning. To make life more meaningful. I mean, that's a challenge for... forever. And if that's the guiding principle... it's hard for me to see... where to fail. I mean, other than that being an extremely difficult task. A task for the ages. A task... well, for every single person. And I think it gets at the crux of what a lot of tools are here for. Because we wish to make life more meaningful. The Industrial Revolution happened so we didn't have to work in fields. So we can make life more meaningful. Improve the quality of our lives. Be able to spend more time doing other things. But I don't know if we have always been successful at this. So I guess that's where we are now. And how do we make life more meaningful? It's all there already. All of the meaning is there. It just has to be discovered. To be seen. To be recognized. To be acknowledged. The oneness. The oneness. The oneness. You look in far enough. That's all you find. I have not found it. But I have an intuition. The same thing with the computers. There is no one. There is inherent relationality between everything. And that is what we are trying to describe. We are basically doing feature extraction on self. We are doing it manually. Manually to start. Some of that can be put in a nice UI and displayed. Spurvis does training data. Storing files. It's very easy for me to begin video and photo too, even if they're just stubbed out. I can just stub everything out and just store it for now. Literally can be as simple as that. The next question is how to make these things relational. And then queryable. Probably queryable first. And then we can figure out how their relationships work. We are going to build a separate frontend client. I'm kind of just going to assume that anything I put in there right now is going to be public. How that's going to work for messages right now, that is something to figure out when we add messages. Hmmm. I'm going to write just a little note in my notebook. Open there."

    title: "\"Rethinking Ownership: The Cloud and Computing Technology\"",
    summary: "The tension between ownership and renting, particularly in the context of technology and cloud computing, is a curious and complex topic that the speaker is exploring. They highlight the idea of effectively renting compute time and space through services like OpenAI and Microsoft Azure, and how reliance on the cloud has become a prevalent aspect of modern computing. The speaker also acknowledges the convenience of storing data in the cloud, even though they may own a computer. They mention OpenAI's work in this area, specifically their assistance API, and express a desire to further explore and challenge their own perspectives on these concepts.",
    text: "There is some level of core tension that I feel and I'm going to try to articulate it. It is basically the tension between, well, I guess, ownership and renting and maybe this is just something that we have come to accept. And maybe my perspective here is on the wrong side of history in some way. Something to explore. But I am very curious when I look at OpenAI and, say, Microsoft Azure, we are effectively renting compute time. And that's totally okay. But, and I guess same with the cloud, generally speaking, we are effectively renting space somewhere. And it is interesting to me that I guess we have come to take the cloud for granted in some way. And I think that even for myself. In the sense that I may own a computer, but most of the data on that computer, in fact, is not local to it. That's not to say that the computer doesn't compute things locally. It certainly does. But things are in the cloud for some level of convenience. So this is a fascinating little piece. And one of the things that I recognize in thinking about what I talked about earlier is that OpenAI has done a fair degree of work in this direction already. That is, they have their assistance API, which effectively, as far as I can tell, implements much of, you know, the brain piece in some way that I guess we all could be effectively chatting into one thread. I don't know how it works with audio files and the like, but they supposedly embed them all. So it could reach out to them. It's possible that this is worth playing around with. Yeah, I think something to think about. I was taking quite a strong position when I was speaking on local earlier. And I'm just basically questioning self in a way. Trying to sharpen positions. So I'm going to stop this and probably do another round of thinking on that in some way and just try to fight myself."

    title: "\"Exploring the Potential of a Micro Social Network\"",
    summary: "The speaker is contemplating creating a micro social network, motivated by both marketing and curiosity, to explore what a small-scale community might look like, with the idea of bringing together a select group of 25 to 100 people to experiment with the concept. They are considering sending out a survey to gauge interest and see if people are willing to collaborate on developing the platform, suggesting that even with basic functionality, like comparing user embeddings, the project could rapidly evolve. The speaker hints at a profound potential in this endeavor and expresses a keen interest in delving into it, as well as providing the means for participants to create their own websites and forge connections. Acknowledging data as a major challenge, they note that providing tools for the community could bring the project closer to addressing this issue.",
    text: "Thinking about maybe some way of God damn it. Oh God. Nice. Thinking about some way partially for marketing, but also partially out of curiosity of what does a micro social network look like? Like, can we get 25 people? Can we get a hundred people? And maybe send out a survey and just see if there is any interest and what that interest may look like and see if people are kind of just down to hack on it and because I suspect that with a few more people in the mix, even with a very imperfect piece of software, um, might just accelerate the thing just fast enough. And even having the most basic query, your embeddings with my embeddings is, um, pretty remarkable I think. And I suspect that there is something deeply, something deep here. And I am very, very curious to explore it. And also at the same time, let these people, um, who have these expressions and maybe have some degree of ability to create website, um, make it easy for them to also create a website and then connect with each other as well. And maybe that's enough. And I guess that's where we're also probably heading again. The big problem is data and that's why I sent tools for that community. And maybe this is, this, this is getting closer to that."

    title: "\"Advancing Parallel Processing and Transformations for Enhanced Model Execution\"",
    summary: "In the first bucket, the focus is on achieving AI-level parallelism, creating a better pipeline, enabling the execution of different LLM tasks in parallel, and allowing future agents to add information to an execution graph. This parallelization is crucial for distributed systems processing and likely to advance the distribution and parallel running of models. The second bucket involves implementing transformations, such as converting unstructured transcripts into organized bullet point lists, and making this adaptable and viable through JSON. The goal is to seamlessly convert text into a GitHub issue, providing instructions for transformation and capturing context to refine models.",
    text: "My previous recording didn't work, so here we are. Gonna simplify my thinking into two buckets, one being AI-level parallelism, basically wanting a better pipeline, and to be able to execute different LLM tasks in parallel, as well as being able to have agents in the future be able to add information to an execution graph. To be able to parallelize that, and that will be very important for distributed systems kind of processing, I believe. I think there's probably gonna be significant advances in how we distribute these models and can run them in parallel. So that seems like an important thing to be able to do from the software side, is getting infrastructure ready to be able to run things in parallel. Execute much faster, basically. And that could come down to hardware level or even network level. I think both need to be covered. The second bucket is transformations and wanting to add some kind of transformation to data on the webpage. For example, turning some unstructured transcript into a bullet point list. I think that makes a lot of sense, and that should be safe to JSON and all of these things, but that's more or less it. I may even want to take this text, for example, and turn it directly into a GitHub issue. As I'm thinking about this, and I really just want it to be like, okay, this thing right here, I know what it is. The agent actually doesn't even need to know what it is immediately. That would be a nice step, but I know it needs to be a GitHub issue, so I'd love to just be able to basically write, turn this into a GitHub issue. Turn bucket two into a GitHub issue, because I could read the transcript and figure out what needs to be done, and I could skim it and get that information. I'm actually not trying to solve the bigger problem yet, because that doesn't matter, and we can effectively capture that context and get the training data as a result of my actions and transformations that I want to make on the data. That gives the model a much better idea of what kinds of things I want to be doing on my data, and that can be used to fine-tune models, I believe."

    title: "\"The Intersection of Personal AI and Individual Spirituality\"",
    summary: "The speaker expresses concerns and questions about the potential for a more personalized AI, drawing parallels between personal AI and individual spirituality. They touch on the idea of an AI like Tanaki inspiring creativity and collaboration, and grapple with how to align their personal vision for AI with the existing narrative and pitch. They emphasize the importance of both aspects, indicating a desire to see both realized without compromising on either. Ultimately, the speaker acknowledges that they are still working through their thoughts and seeking a way to bring their ideas to life within this context.",
    text: "Following up on what I just sent, I find that I have many, many, many, many questions that basically rely on the same thing. And I think that if this problem can be solved, and there's good tooling around it, not only, well, A, an agent like Tanaki seems, like, much more friendly than just, like, a generic computer. If it's personal AI, you probably want some kind of personal thing to be interacting with. And if I take from Hinduism, and, like, Pasquale, you may not like this one in particular, but everyone has their own god, effectively, at least as I understand it. And in some way, that own god is, could be, like, spiritually similar to everyone has their own personal AI, effectively. And it may have those values and beliefs that you kind of embody and put into it. And it's like, Tanaki is Pasquale's personal AI, and also may go around to other people, and, you know, effectively, like, try to inspire them in those same ways to take on creativity and collaboration. But mine will probably be a bit different. So anyhow, this is some of the things that I'm thinking about. I am trying to think about it personally, from my point of view, what I would like to build, and how that fits into the overall narrative and pitch that we have already. Maybe it doesn't. Maybe it's a different pitch. Maybe it's a different angle to the same thing. But I would like very much to bring both into existence still. And I don't, I think they both are extremely important, and I don't really want to sacrifice on that. So this is something I don't, I don't know exactly what I'm saying yet. I'm just kind of working the problem out loud."

And working on that, and that would be nice. And maybe just basically sharing more and more of my thinking as it comes in some form or another, and maybe some of that can be a bit of the Manifesto stuff.

Not having to be necessarily political, but like, just straight up ideas, and these are the opinions that I have, and putting them out there, and let's see, let's see.

    summary: "The speaker is exploring the idea of having a watch that can automatically track their activities such as surfing, climbing, and going to the gym based on their location. They are interested in whether this data can be gathered from the raw sensors and inferred later on, rather than in real time. They mention that GPS location and time while driving can provide a sense of what is happening and suggest that phone activity and location only need to be recorded at specific intervals, expressing a desire for their phone to be able to infer context and understand the relationships between different activities based on these data points.",
    text: "One of the things that I'm thinking about is the ability to... This is, again, context. Like, what would it be like to be able to have a watch that just understands that I went surfing, or that I went climbing, or that I'm going to the gym. I guess one of the things in my world that's easy is place plays a massive role in those things. You know, if I've not explicitly told the computer, like, if I go to SWAMI's and then I'm not near my phone for an hour, likely the case is that I went surfing. One of the things that I'm curious about is, like, can all of that data be gathered like from the raw sensors and then inferred later on? It actually doesn't need to be inferred in real time. Real time would be great. So, yeah, something to think about. I definitely want to think about... Yeah, I don't know. Even something like driving, like GPS location and time gives you a lot of a sense of what is happening. And some of me is like, okay, well, my phone, when my phone is active, I only really need my GPS location to be recorded, like, you know, every five minutes, honestly, plenty. I mean, every minute would be fantastic. But even then, there's different granularities. So, so, even regardless of that, yeah, having my phone be able to infer context seems really important to me. To be able to understand the relations between different things. So,"

They are willing to take a job in such a space and believe it's worth doing. The goal is to build tools that make it easy for the individual to work with their data directly on a web page. They plan to move to a more reactive front end using Next.js and React, designing a feed and query system possibly using natural language. The speaker also mentions working on embedding audio and ensuring embeddings are accessible.\n\nThe text discusses the process of obtaining and manipulating data and emphasizes the importance of experimentation and innovation. It uses the metaphor of building a playground to illustrate the iterative nature of the process, acknowledging that initial attempts may be imperfect but can be improved upon through learning from mistakes. The writer anticipates challenges but expresses a hope to avoid negative consequences and eventually achieve success. Finally, the text concludes with a lighthearted remark and a reference to going to sleep.",
    text: "What I just spoke about is effectively an aspiration. I was writing in my journal earlier about what communities do I want to be part of, and I guess that is one of the ones that I want to be part of. And being able to participate in that space as deeply as I can, I guess that's something that I'm very interested in at the moment, and I'm willing to push forward and potentially take a job doing that as well, because I think it's important. And I think building great tools for individuals and empowering individuals to play and explore their data and bring it back to themselves is something very much worth doing, because I think it's worth it for myself. I don't know what I am yet to discover, but I am sure I am going to discover something. And to aid in more people's discoveries, that excites me. It excites me in the same way that I'm excited to ask questions over my data, and even these things that I'm saying, it seems like with the power of the large language model and these little modules and plugins and making good ones for people by default, I just suspect that it's going to be really useful. And I could be entirely wrong, but I need to build the mini playground and try to make it happen and see what's possible from there. And I think that's kind of the guiding principle now, more or less, which is, well, start getting some of this recorded data in, see what we can switch off of OpenAI, see what models perform like what. And yeah, I mean, more or less, I think that's kind of the way. So yeah, I mean, we'll just take a run at it and kind of see how it goes. And as long as I can build tooling for myself to make it easy, you know, that's where we'll get to. But I think getting that web page up and literally just having a piece of data and some metadata in front of me and being able to work with it and being able to do some of that directly on the page, it doesn't even need to be saved to the file, being able to just work with it and manipulate it on the page, I suspect is going to be extremely useful. Again, how all of this is stored and logged and everything, I don't know yet. But I think that's more or less the direction for tomorrow is, well, really the rest of the week is just getting this onto a page and probably doing it from a third party application. I don't know yet. All I know is I'm probably going to hit the limit with BUN in terms of statically rendering things. So I want to move to a more reactive front end. And because of that, I will probably end up using Next.js and React to do that and a bunch of client components. I'll keep as much as I can on the server and keep it really simple. I'm going to keep it really, really simple and use BUN to run it, but that's going to be the goal. And yeah, just make a little tiny playground for myself. Probably a feed to begin with. I mean, we'll see. We'll see how much I can get away with. I don't know how this is going to work yet. I want to query it ideally all by natural language. So we will see what we can get out of it as a result of that. Don't know how much GPT this is going to need, or maybe I can just run something with JSON grammar and have it output me exactly what I want. But if we get there by the end of the week, that'll be a pretty satisfying end point. I think the pipeline is in good enough shape. We have pretty good audio going in. I think we need to make sure embeddings are making their way into the embedding space. But really, it's just going to be about getting the data in and then starting to play with it in one way or the other. That's going to be, yeah, I think playing with it is going to be the next step. Building. Building the playground. We have, we have the sand. Now let's build the playground. That's what needs to be done. Setting up the first set of monkey bars. And seeing how it is, it's probably going to be janky and rusty and crappy, but, you know, it'll be fun until it hurts someone. And we'll learn from that mistake and make it better. And, I guess, hopefully it doesn't hurt someone. That's the goal. Oh boy, here we go. Time to go to sleep."

And I think that this is why maybe targeting DEVs and making it very easy to do that initially is really the right way to go, basically allowing the open ecosystem to find the killer app. But one of the things that I wonder is, with the right set of protocols in place, how quickly could I build an amazing dating app? I mean, partially it is relevant in my life to some degree. And also, how quick could you build new social networks with a different paradigm? DIY social network. How can you make it easy for anyone to build a social network? I certainly would love this for different communities in my life. Facebook groups solve something. But to have it more deeply integrated, not only if you could just build things with natural language for the social network, and if it had its own page, SoCal climbers, SoCal highliners. I mean, for me, that would be sick. I would absolutely love that. And beyond that, if I could basically get that feed to me when I think about the question of, what do I want to do this weekend? And given that, it might be able to read those feeds effectively and be like, there's a Highline gathering this weekend. Maybe you want to go to that. That would be great. Or even getting a notification proactively, like, hey, by the way, someone is hosting a Highline gathering this weekend, and I notice you don't have any weekend plans yet. Maybe that's what you want to do. So anyhow, these are very basic things. But I really do believe that putting data all in one place kind of unlocks a lot of potential for social interactions beyond the self-insight stuff that it could also kind of provide. But honestly, it's almost like the social and the DIY networks that are somehow much more interesting."

And back into experiencing the world more fully. And same thing is the computer screen. We just miniaturized it. I guess we're going to slap it on our faces here quite soon. But I wonder in the implementation of slapping it on our face, whether that affords us the opportunity to bring back the attention span in some ways. And highlight the curiosities of the world in real time. Yeah, that's what I'm super, super curious about."

It's crucial for me to detach the mental process from the technical aspect of building a website, as the conflation of both is overwhelming.

Moreover, it will help distinguish between the user interface and the core system functions.",

I'm going to meditate before I get into work and trying to put trying to put some of these ideas into practice with what I've written already. Not just staying out an idea land, but trying to implement them and getting base level viability out there. I think it needs to be done. I really need to be able to separate out the brain component from building a website. I think that is absolutely critical because it's driving me insane right now trying to do that already but beyond that I think it'll make it much easier for other people to use. And it won't be perfect. Some of the low-level functionality is probably going to stay within the brain for now and it's going to be kind of a pain to work with. But that'll help us discover what are the things that do need to be abstracted. And what separates user space from kernel land in some way as well."

The author envisions using an AI system to capture and analyze their conversations at home to elucidate thinking patterns and make them accessible. Additionally, they discuss the limitations of vector algorithms in representing complex questions and suggest the need for a new approach.\n\nThe speaker suggests that while their idea is a starting point, further exploration is necessary to determine its relevance and significance. They reflect on the process of developing a deeper understanding and consider the practical aspects of implementing their thoughts about how the brain is constructed.",
    "text": "One other thing that I wish to mention is I think personal AI is going to have to be quite holistic. And I think I mentioned this previously, but I want to emphasize it in this message. That for the computer to be able to answer these more complex questions, it does need to know a fair bit about me. I think that will probably happen again inevitably. I think we are seeing people push that direction with devices like Tab and Rewind and all of this. I think that these things are a bit too early personally. I find the concept very interesting, but I cannot see it catching on at this moment. However, I do believe that it will catch on at some point. Whether that is a society we want to have or not is a different question. But I also think that there is possibility to influence that society, even if it is inevitable. In what ways do we wish to allow ourselves to be seen to others? I guess that is probably an open question and something that can be pushed on. It does not need to be just like everyone is surveilled all the time. It does not necessarily need to be that. I think that this is a broader thing that is happening in the world that is worthwhile to think about. And to not get, at least for me, too sad about. It is something that can be done thoughtfully and probably should be done thoughtfully. So, yes. Basically what I was saying is that this does need to be holistic. Listening at some point probably will be a thing. I am speaking into this thing right now. I wish to have something like this in my home and I will build that. I do wish to record what I am saying in my home. Maybe not all the time. But I find that good conversations happen at home. And to be able to have that in some kind of second brain could elucidate some of my patterns of thinking. And put some of those patterns out into the world, hopefully. In some way that is what I am doing right now by speaking into this. That I wish that I can look at these patterns at a broader level. Have bullet points of what they are and be able to dive into each of those bullet points. And that can be done very loosely. It does not need to be hyper-organized like a file system. The brain is the new file system. You can kind of just dump whatever the fuck you want in there and know you can retrieve it later. Yes, maybe there is still some hierarchy and stuff just because it is useful. It does not mean throw everything completely out. We can leverage the existing things that we have to make this new thing even better. It is not just a vector database. That is not enough. We need some kind of log whether that log be in a database or some other form. It is needed so we can look through time. And also be able to quickly access relevant information that may not be specifically related to vectors. Vectors give us an intuition. Let me say that again. Vectors give us an intuition. They get us in the ballpark and the neighborhood. But that may not always be enough. A sufficiently complex question will be in multiple neighborhoods. And that will be hard, I believe, to represent in vector space in a single question. Maybe it gets close enough. But from the vector algorithms that I have seen so far, it often does not get close enough. Maybe that is the performance of the one that we are using. There are others. This is something to be evaluated, but it gets you in the ballpark. So after you get in the ballpark, you need to do more to figure out what is actually salient and relevant to that question. Anyhow, this is me thinking about out loud about more implementation level details of how the brain would get made."

They express a desire to work with an individual named Chandler to utilize their collected photographs, stories, and voice notes from Japan to create a website powered by natural language queries. Additionally, the speaker reflects on the potential resurgence of web rings as a means to foster unique internet communities that appreciate diversity, suggesting these could be structured through natural language. The speaker believes that these ideas, including the reincorporation of web rings and the Japan project, form a coherent vision that can be communicated to others, and they plan to record these thoughts for future reference.",
    "text": "Another aspect of this is me just basically rethinking about the TRIPS project that I had in the past. And one thing that I'm very keen on to experiment with is, well, to figure out how to get all of the data that I have on Japan into a web page or a brain thing and basically use that as the album. That is the media artifact. And right now, maybe that is its own separate thing. But overall, eventually, that should be part of the same network. But we can experiment with it in a little form. And basically, I would love to work with Chandler to take our Japan photos, our Japan stories, and our Japan voice notes and see what little website we can build out of that just through natural language queries. I feel like that would be quite fascinating in a lot of aspects. So these are the main three things that I'm talking about. And the other one was, I mean, I mentioned it in the first note that I recorded. But again, web rings. I think web rings are basically ripe. There is a certain kind of hunger for it. And a getting away from the global village and being like, OK, well, how do we form communities in a different kind of way? How do we create internet spaces very easily? And internet spaces that are diverse, that show our diversity. And I do believe that possibly that can be done just straight up through natural language. And in some sense, these things that I said form, I believe, a coherent enough vision for someone else to understand. So that is a possibility. I'm going to note it down here. But I believe that some of these notes maybe at least push in a more concrete direction."

I think it is obvious. And if you do not see it as obvious, you probably should not be investing. I think this is an obvious thing to see. And by unlocking it, you should understand inherently that it is extraordinarily valuable. And our quest as a company is to make the connections between data as easy to use as possible.

They express a desire to build the underlying infrastructure that allows various input methods to interface with personal data effectively, likening it to the function of IO devices in computers but extended to human bodies and senses. Recognizing the inevitability of change in technology, they prefer not to commit to a single form factor, instead aiming to create a flexible space that supports a wide array of experiments and inputs. Their vision is to foster an environment that accommodates continuous innovation and supports everyone, without being limited by current design paradigms.",
    "text": "The next bit of writing has to do with, I don't think we have found a form factor yet for how this is going to operate in someone's life. I think Avi and Tab and the Humane thing and all of this is our first ditch attempt at making a system like this. But what I think is, well, I want to build the underlying infrastructure that makes those things possible. At the end of the day, those things are input methods. And I want to be able to support a broad range of input methods and hopefully in a very relatively small API space. The kernel for your personal data. And just like we have IO devices and things like that in computers, now this is extending it to our bodies and our senses. And I think that that definitely will need to be covered and probably can be covered quite simply. And it'll take experimentation to get there, but I think we can do it. And given that, yeah, where I want to play is, I want to support everything and everyone. I don't need to take a strong opinion on what the form factor is going to be right now, because it will change in six months. It will change in a year and a half. I would rather create the space that affords many different experiments to evolve and not get sucked into one or the other. And that is part of what I would like to create."

    "summary": "The cost of computing power is expected to decrease, leading to increased availability. This makes the ability to utilize this computing power for extensive processing or post-processing very important, especially with evolving hardware architectures. If supported, doing massively parallel inference and leveraging large language models for parallel post-processing will likely be both feasible and significant. The trend towards more accessible compute resources will thus play a pivotal role in the advancement of post-processing capabilities and the application of large language models.",
    "text": "One interesting thing is that the cost of compute, or rather the amount of compute that will be available is only going to go up. So being able to take advantage of that compute and do lots and lots of processing or post-processing does seem extremely relevant to me, especially as architectures continue to evolve on the hardware side is, assuming we can support something like this and do massively parallel inference, being able to do a lot of parallel post-processing via large language models seems very reasonably done and probably fairly important as well."

The speaker questions the need for large companies to conduct all operations internally, proposing that concentrated capital expenditures might be more effective, and uses TSMC as an example while also acknowledging the possibility that their ideas might not be valid. Overall, the speaker is curious about the potential for market disruption through a reimagined corporate structure and is seeking to view the market through this new perspective.",
    "text": "I wonder if we're ready for a more efficient market and I wonder if that means redetermining what the market looks like in some way to, um, I don't know exactly what I'm trying to say here. And I think probably realistically, the issue is so complex that it's hard to encapsulate in such a tiny thought, um, is probably the reality, but my, my main point being here is I wonder if it makes sense to actually specialize to a higher degree in some way and having lots of smaller, more focused, um, kind of companies, you know, maxing out at like maybe 500 people or something. And part of this is just talking with Chandler and, you know, him being like, well, we have nothing to do. Like I could do my job in an hour. And I think that shows that the rate of technology growth has been fantastic. And it also means that, well, we don't want to, like, basically we want people to have jobs, but we also don't want them doing nothing like we want to utilize their time effectively. And I think by utilizing time effectively, you have happier people. Um, and you also can work less in some ways. Like I don't think every company needs to be peddled to the metal. I think there will be companies that do that and probably they are important. And, um, in the markets that they compete in, it may be necessary to do so. For example, like TSMC, however, yeah, like I, I basically just wanted to wonder what is, what is a strategy for, um, disruption of, of large companies? Like I, in, in some ways, like again, using TSMC as an example, well, maybe not everything needs to be done in house. Um, and maybe that capex can actually be, um, more concentrated in some way. Like one company who does massive capital expenditures in a very sophisticated place. Um, I guess Illumina is probably maybe one example of this, but they are quite huge. Um, I don't know. It, it, I'm just curious and I want to look at the market through this lens a bit and see if what I'm saying even makes any sense at all, because it's quite possible that it absolutely is just garbage thinking."

Like, well, why I say this specifically is that the way I interact with the world is primarily visual. I do think auditory is very important, but even in the sense of being able to describe the world visually for blind folks, as well as for people with sight, being able to see visualizations of information. Visualizations of information are extremely important, in my opinion, and I suspect that those navigational structures are not going to go away in a pure AI assistant kind of thing. Like, it does need to bring up visualizations on the fly. That is one of the things that it needs to do, and that needs to be fundamentally supported at the base level, I believe."

All of these things, voice notes, whatever, I think giving this brain that much context probably enables it to... Probably enables it to, I guess, understand you and things and what you want much better. Maybe this is me just being a little bit too crazy and fucking out there, but I fucking hate fragmentation of data. It drives me insane. I wish I had better control of my data because if I could ask it more questions, it would be way more useful to me in the sense that also from a business perspective, well, if I had an aggregate of my data somewhere. Now, if other people want to ask me questions on that data, over that data set, they can have their individual slice of the data if they're producing it. But what if you want to ask bigger questions, questions in aggregate of that data? It needs to be stored somewhere centrally to be able to do that effectively. And the fact that we do not have that is a massive problem for learning, generally speaking. And those learnings and insights, I suspect, could be used for business as well. This is a whole bigger question. I don't know if what I'm saying here makes sense, like, cognitively. I don't really know exactly what I'm saying here, but it is something that I wish to develop further."

If John has one of these, again, I really would like to have that feed that is algorithmically, in some way, very related to things that I care about.

    "text": "I am in the process of thinking about a module system for the brain. That is, right now we have effectively one, well, we'll call it two modules of different hierarchies or orders. The first module is the audio file handler. That is, when we submit an audio file, some things happen as a result of that. The module that we run on top of it, well, I guess there's a couple, potentially, that we run on top of it. One is the summarization module. Just to get a summary of that audio, something really simple, concise, and lets you glance at it. That's as simple as it is for now. But in the future, it's possible that people will want to implement their own modules. Right now, it won't go that far as to have other people implement their own modules, but it will make my process of writing new modules much easier, and from there, we can begin to think about how others may implement them in the future. But given this, to make the process easier, I have two suggested modules that I'm curious about. The first is a module called questions. Questions is a module that takes the text and tries to extract any salient questions from it. This module may be extended in the future, but for now, that's all it will try and do, is make a list of questions. Maybe in JSON format, maybe not. Who knows? For now, it's a first attempt. So that's one module I'd like to add. There's another module that I'd like to add, which is another kind of feature extraction module, which is like what the questions is. It's extracting questions from the thing. And it may return nothing as well, and that's totally okay. The second one is a feature extraction module called people. We want to extract names and people from the text. This probably will come in very handy in the future. Exactly what that looks like right now, don't know. But I can imagine queries of that being very relevant. And that can be with inside the data or not. And perhaps even there's an entire higher order module called people that this attends to, that the brain is aware of all of the other modules that may be impacted as a result of something going in. And likely, because these modules are all aware of each other, we have to set some recursive depth limit on all of them. That is if they are constantly updating each other in result, what is to stop that going on for infinity? That is precisely the problem. We will probably limit it to three. Depth of three. Or four or five or something. Something fairly low. So it impacts the modules that are primary first. And anyhow, yes, this is just an overview of kind of what I am thinking. And it's also partially a test to make sure the cleanup that I did works nicely."

And what I mean by that is one of the things that I might want to ask it is, hey, can you plan what activities I'm going to do this week? And for me, thinking about it from a technology perspective, I need the brain now to do some extra things that it maybe wasn't doing before. Specifically, thinking about feature extraction and metadata extraction from text or whatever forms, images, whatever. And it should know through that feature extraction, okay, CJ is a climber or CJ likes to surf, CJ likes to slackline, X, Y, and Z. And then be able to do maybe some reaching out to the internet for weather and surf conditions. And maybe if there's interoperability with my friends, their brains, and whatever they're willing to share with me, that it looks at their schedules to some degree and can be like, okay, here's a proposal, CJ, for what your week might look like. Surf at Monday at Ocean Beach because the conditions are looking really good, X, Y, and Z, it's like this. And then maybe on Tuesday, go climb with Patrick because Patrick is free and he wants to go climb Mount Woodson. And maybe on Wednesday, go surf again, the swell has died out a little bit, but it's perfect conditions at Swami's, blah, blah, blah. Whatever, Thursday, go slackline, the weather is going to be terrible for surfing and no one's available to be a climbing partner and then whatever else. And then it's like, for the weekend, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Anyway, I think we've talked about, you probably don't want your entire life to be driven by this thing, but there are aspects of life that are nice to absolve. I do spend a lot of time looking at surf cameras and weather and surf reports and blah, blah, blah. I do spend a fair amount of time doing all of that and it's okay, but it doesn't always feel like I really want to be spending my time doing that. Anyhow, I literally have like 70 to 100 questions written down that do this, but my main point, the main point I was saying in all of this is that this is an application platform and the question that I just described is effectively like a little brain module. And it should not be up to me or anyone to create all of those brain modules. That is an insane task. And maybe the brains get better and better, but over time, I think the biggest thing is that anyone should have the ability and the tools at their hands to be able to create and compose these modules that make it effective for their lives. And in whatever way that means, but that is really like what I'm curious about in some way. And beyond that, when talking about other people's brains, now we can start communicating between them. That is a protocol. And personally, I want this to be a better friend. Like I am not always the best of friends because my brain just doesn't remember people all the time. It's not always good at that. And I do wish to make that process easier. And maybe all of that's a farce. Maybe I just need to work on that myself. But regardless, there are things here that I think are probably genuinely useful and can be used for personal growth."

    "text": "Feeling good about tomorrow. It's quite late. I guess I'm still excited in my body. And I'm getting the energy to express. And I don't know exactly what the expression is going to be yet. But one of the things that I feel recently is seeing all of these announcements and demos and things, it's for me as a developer, trying to solve some of these things definitely doesn't feel super trivial. And to be fair, I haven't been working on it very, very long. I haven't been working on it with a team of people. So maybe this is partially the issue. There's also very little documentation out there for the kinds of things that I'm experimenting with. And as Raphael said, I probably should go and basically write down my learnings. And, you know, I guess that's something that I'll write down on my questions list. So let me do that real fast. Right. So I guess the point of this message, in some way, is I'm trying to do the darn thing. And I don't want to be afraid to put out half-baked work. As in, it does actually work. It's not perfect. But I also want to have a call to action to be like, if we do this together, it will be a better world. And I don't need to hide behind doing things behind closed doors and seeing that demos may or may not be real. I've built many demos in my life. I know how easy it is to potentially impress someone with a demo. But behind the scenes, you know, it's the Homer Simpson-like meme with his back clipped together so he looks super sexy. Like, no. I'm tired of doing that. I'm tired of doing that. And I'm actively trying to write code in such a way where it is not doing that and also write calls to large language models where it's not doing that. And I'm also not perfect. Like, what I just described is an agential system. To do that correctly is an agential system. And I do not have the right understanding to build a very effective agential system right now. I don't. But I do believe that is generally the direction we are going. And that is the direction we should be going. And how do we get there? And how do we begin to process large amounts of data to put it in the right format? How do we connect data sources to each other? Those are all open and important questions to form an overall better context of who we are. And I would love to say just like shoving all the documents into RAG and pulling out the top five is going to work. But like, I just don't know how that's going to fucking work. It's just not enough context about someone. I can't fit my context in five documents unless those documents are perfect documents. And maybe through large language models we can start generating more perfect documents for them."

    "text": "Overall, I think these last submissions that I've talked about are powerful. And with Tanaki as the muser, I think can come into reality in a very meaningful way. I don't want to be interacting with just GPT personally. Some people might, but that's not what I want. I think a lot of the brain that I have described, we have seen people take it in a business direction. Upload all of your company's documents to this thing and now you have an amazing knowledge base. That's great, but that does not apply to me in any meaningful way. The questions that I am going to ask are very different than the questions a business will ask. And I do truly believe that more of the power of these tools that we have is in the hands of individuals and people than it is in the hands of corporations. I think it will still make tons of money in corporations. I have no doubt about that. But I really do believe that in the hands of people, this technology has the potential to change the world dramatically for the better. It will change the world no matter what. But I think if we can provide people amazing tools for themselves and for their friends, that is an extremely positive thing. And on the silicon point that I am talking about, I want to do a little bit of research to make sure this is accurate. But given the fact that we can already run large language models on an iPhone, that is a possibility we can do it. I suspect that in a few years time, we will likely get GPT 3.5 or GPT 4 level performance being able to run on a mobile device. That is an interesting concept in and of itself. I think that this has the ability to profoundly change how we interact with computers. I think it has profound impact on how we interact with information generally speaking. What does the internet look like when you have something that has that capability? Also, it reminds me a bit of early computing. I could be entirely off base here. I tend to be extremely optimistic about local compute. So that is my bias. But early computers were mainframes. They were not for the individual. They were not for the individual. They were for companies and we had terminals to access them. In a large way, we have gone back to that because that has been what is most profitable at this moment. But the democratization of this kind of compute, I believe, will come to everyone. It is inevitable that it will come to everyone. And I would rather be on that curve. And given that possibility, I think we will not always need to rely on open AI. It is very possible that businesses will rely on open AI just like they rely on IBM to this day. Open AI is not going away. But the kinds of data that businesses are doing is a lot different than the kinds of data that I am doing. The scale of that is entirely different. So the scale of compute required is also entirely different. This is to say, I really believe in this direction going forward. And I think it has the possibility to bring a lot of value. Even though right now it looks a bit gloomy in some way. It is for nerds."

Additionally, there is a mention of potential open source offerings and hosted options for running the system, as well as the possibility of developing hardware to make self-running more feasible in the future.",
    "text": "So to kind of summarize all of the things that I've been talking about in some kind of, I guess, I was using them in concrete kind of questions and applications that I could see. I kind of want to step back and what are the the overall overarching things maybe. And I think the first thing is a secure second brain. What exactly what that means, I am not sure. But I believe in all of those words in some way. I believe that it is important that this is not just open fully to the public. I don't want my brain just leaking everywhere. There are parts of my brain that I am super happy to leak. In fact, I'm probably happier than most people to leak a lot of it. Leak is not really the right word either. It's really share. But there's also a bunch of things that I don't necessarily want to share. I'm not comfortable sharing it. So that's, that's one piece. And I think in that the thing is, is having modules and basically having it have some level of composability in and of itself. So people can build these higher order modules, figuring out what those abstractions are. And I think through musering Tanaki and Pascal throwing out tons of ideas, we get a sense of what it may be like to build those abstractions. So we don't have to build specific implementations every time, but we have a generic implementation that can be used for many, many things. That I think is valuable. And if those abstractions can be provided to more people, I think people will pay for that. The second piece is kind of the piece in some way that we're starting to move into slowly, which is brain introspection tools is this brain is nice, but without any way to look at it in a variety of ways, you don't really get a sense of how to interact with it. And it probably will become natural at some point, but the first iterations may look like a website, a dashboard, what is salient to you? This is very generic and broad and is probably incorrect. But I'm just throwing it out there as we will probably want that this as researchers to be able to introspect and poke at it. And then, as a person, I also want it for some of the questions that I've begun to ask, even for Dr. Lingenberry, I would be curious, who are the people that Dr. Lingen knows about? That's that question itself is completely related to, like my life as well. What does it know about my friends? That is, that is super fucking relevant. So anyhow, yes. And then the last little piece is the interoperability that I talked about is it should be able to talk to other people's brains. And in fact, create group brains and all of this kind of thing, creating protocols to do that. I mean, exactly how this is implemented, I am not sure. I think that there should be open source offerings where you can choose to run this yourself. And there also maybe is a hosted option where you don't want to run it because that's a fucking pain. But I also think that it's worth maybe eventually building hardware that makes it really easy to run yourself. And right now that might not be feasible. But in five years, the silicon is going to be available where it will be very easy to do that. Or I believe that the silicon will be there. I could be wrong, but I follow the industry quite closely."

One of the things that I do wonder is if these large language models are going to be run locally on devices.

The possible expansion to different data sources is a concern, and I'm contemplating an 'agential' architecture where agents manage different types of data. To effectively answer questions with available data, we might use a system that assembles JSON objects, but how to handle various embedding spaces for different data types like audio or text remains uncertain.",
    "text": "One thing that I just realized for myself is I don't need to have the answer to the question today. And if I could have the answer to the question by Friday, my original goal, that would be good enough. I don't need to have an MVP by Friday. I just want to have a screenshot by Friday. If I can have that, then I think we are moving towards something. If by Friday we do not have it, then that's a different issue. I guess at that point, we have to reevaluate based on where we're at. Are we any closer? Are we in the same place? And this is even before extending out data sources, which is something I'm mildly concerned about, how to make that really good and possible. I think given the framework and structure of what I have currently, it should be possible if we can answer the questions in this context, but it also may not be. And that is something that I'm going to have to think about and probably contend with in some way. And perhaps this is where I need to think about some agential type architecture where we kind of have agents for effectively kinds of data or something like that. I'm not sure. Where if you need to collect or collate some data, basically they are the ones containing the knowledge of the structures, something to that degree. Basically, how would you access those kind of pieces of information? And again, maybe the pipeline of assembling JSON objects is kind of the way that you do that, of like, okay, if I had this JSON object and I had that JSON object, I can answer this question effectively. Maybe that's a way of going about it. And maybe that's something to try in the sense like having an audio retriever and what data is embedded, what those embeddings mean, you know, blah, blah, blah. And maybe that's the same for, say, text messages or journals or whatever. Maybe those are in the same embedding spaces or maybe they're in different embedding spaces. That I'm not quite sure about yet. I suspect sometimes you'll want them to be in the same embedding space and I suspect other times you will not. So this is just like my first little attempt at thinking about this."

That's the mentality that I want to come into it with because I don't know what the most amazing thing is going to be, but I think, like, I know Scott has so many good ideas and I want to provide him tools to make something great and that's kind of exactly where I'm at, and I'm just stoked that he wants to explore this area and hopefully I can get something into his hands and we can do that exploration, and, you know, with Charuz as well and whoever else wants to participate, but, yeah, super, super interesting, super psyched, so much energy right now, I'm about to go slackline, we'll see how that goes, maybe a person shows up, maybe they don't, but, yeah, holy crap, so much energy and then oh, boy."

    "title": "\"Meaningful Business: Navigating Challenges and Focusing on the Big Picture\"",
    "summary": "Jeff Bezos discusses the importance of focusing on the \"big things\" in business rather than being overwhelmed by the \"paper cuts,\" or small issues that can accumulate and harm a company. He emphasizes the need to identify what will not change in the long term and to address ongoing challenges, such as the impact of technology on society and the need for meaningful connections and self-expression. Bezos also highlights the significance of nurturing curiosity and creativity to navigate the evolving world effectively. Ultimately, he suggests that striving to make life more meaningful and purposeful is a timeless and universal challenge facing everyone.\n\nThe text highlights the desire to make life more meaningful, referencing the Industrial Revolution as an effort to improve the quality of life and allow for more time for other activities. However, it questions whether this goal has been achieved. It also suggests that the potential for meaning already exists and needs to be discovered, recognized, and acknowledged through recognizing the interconnectedness of everything, including the oneness of all things. Additionally, it discusses the parallel between this search for meaning and the extraction of features in computers, implying that the process of manually extracting meaning can eventually be displayed in a user-friendly interface.\n\nSpurvis is focused on training data and storing files, and they are considering adding support for videos and photos. They plan to initially store this data with a simple setup and later make it relational and queryable. Additionally, they intend to build a separate frontend client, and they are considering the public accessibility of the content they will add. They also mention the need to figure out how messages will work when added and plan to make a note about it in their notebook.",
    "text": "I'm listening to Jeff Bezos on the Lex Friedman podcast. And one of the things that I find very fascinating is something that Jeff just said in this podcast, which is basically this idea between the big things and paper cuts. And the paper cuts are like all of the small things that, you know, customers don't like effectively. And there is death by a thousand paper cuts. And so that is definitely something to avoid. But it also makes me think that's not something that runs the business. And it is something that makes the business continue to be the best it can be. But it seems like the question of what are the big things, he mentions, are what is not going to change in ten years from today? And for me, in the industry that I'm in, and that I enjoy, is, well, to me, it doesn't seem like computers are going to slow down. And that's one thing. But that doesn't impact people. Directly. Indirectly, it has a million knock-on effects. But in terms of how to make life better, maybe is identifying some of the ways in which, I guess, there is pain or suffering. And being able to identify those and work through those. For me, one of the things that I care about the most, and that I struggle with the most, especially when it comes to, you know, the things that I do, and that I struggle with the most, especially when I'm single or going through a change in life, is, you know, connecting with friends. And also just generally being able to express myself. I think those are two things that are not going to be any easier. Well, they're going to be a problem in 10 years, and they're going to be a problem today. Expressing self is an ongoing process. There's also another, which is creativity. Or curiosity, rather. I think that that's something I wish to encourage. But this does not have... I mean, moving into the world that we are, I think curiosity is going to need to be heightened. And honestly, as I look into the world, I do kind of see it. And I don't think it is restricted just to the weirdos that I hang around, quite frankly. And I love my weirdos. I say that only in the most loving way. And... Yeah, what did I say the other day? The other day is meaning. To make life more meaningful. I mean, that's a challenge for... forever. And if that's the guiding principle... it's hard for me to see... where to fail. I mean, other than that being an extremely difficult task. A task for the ages. A task... well, for every single person. And I think it gets at the crux of what a lot of tools are here for. Because we wish to make life more meaningful. The Industrial Revolution happened so we didn't have to work in fields. So we can make life more meaningful. Improve the quality of our lives. Be able to spend more time doing other things. But I don't know if we have always been successful at this. So I guess that's where we are now. And how do we make life more meaningful? It's all there already. All of the meaning is there. It just has to be discovered. To be seen. To be recognized. To be acknowledged. The oneness. The oneness. The oneness. You look in far enough. That's all you find. I have not found it. But I have an intuition. The same thing with the computers. There is no one. There is inherent relationality between everything. And that is what we are trying to describe. We are basically doing feature extraction on self. We are doing it manually. Manually to start. Some of that can be put in a nice UI and displayed. Spurvis does training data. Storing files. It's very easy for me to begin video and photo too, even if they're just stubbed out. I can just stub everything out and just store it for now. Literally can be as simple as that. The next question is how to make these things relational. And then queryable. Probably queryable first. And then we can figure out how their relationships work. We are going to build a separate frontend client. I'm kind of just going to assume that anything I put in there right now is going to be public. How that's going to work for messages right now, that is something to figure out when we add messages. Hmmm. I'm going to write just a little note in my notebook. Open there."

They highlight the idea of effectively renting compute time and space through services like OpenAI and Microsoft Azure, and how reliance on the cloud has become a prevalent aspect of modern computing. The speaker also acknowledges the convenience of storing data in the cloud, even though they may own a computer. They mention OpenAI's work in this area, specifically their assistance API, and express a desire to further explore and challenge their own perspectives on these concepts.",
    "text": "There is some level of core tension that I feel and I'm going to try to articulate it. It is basically the tension between, well, I guess, ownership and renting and maybe this is just something that we have come to accept. And maybe my perspective here is on the wrong side of history in some way. Something to explore. But I am very curious when I look at OpenAI and, say, Microsoft Azure, we are effectively renting compute time. And that's totally okay. But, and I guess same with the cloud, generally speaking, we are effectively renting space somewhere. And it is interesting to me that I guess we have come to take the cloud for granted in some way. And I think that even for myself. In the sense that I may own a computer, but most of the data on that computer, in fact, is not local to it. That's not to say that the computer doesn't compute things locally. It certainly does. But things are in the cloud for some level of convenience. So this is a fascinating little piece. And one of the things that I recognize in thinking about what I talked about earlier is that OpenAI has done a fair degree of work in this direction already. That is, they have their assistance API, which effectively, as far as I can tell, implements much of, you know, the brain piece in some way that I guess we all could be effectively chatting into one thread. I don't know how it works with audio files and the like, but they supposedly embed them all. So it could reach out to them. It's possible that this is worth playing around with. Yeah, I think something to think about. I was taking quite a strong position when I was speaking on local earlier. And I'm just basically questioning self in a way. Trying to sharpen positions. So I'm going to stop this and probably do another round of thinking on that in some way and just try to fight myself."

    "text": "Thinking about maybe some way of God damn it. Oh God. Nice. Thinking about some way partially for marketing, but also partially out of curiosity of what does a micro social network look like? Like, can we get 25 people? Can we get a hundred people? And maybe send out a survey and just see if there is any interest and what that interest may look like and see if people are kind of just down to hack on it and because I suspect that with a few more people in the mix, even with a very imperfect piece of software, um, might just accelerate the thing just fast enough. And even having the most basic query, your embeddings with my embeddings is, um, pretty remarkable I think. And I suspect that there is something deeply, something deep here. And I am very, very curious to explore it. And also at the same time, let these people, um, who have these expressions and maybe have some degree of ability to create website, um, make it easy for them to also create a website and then connect with each other as well. And maybe that's enough. And I guess that's where we're also probably heading again. The big problem is data and that's why I sent tools for that community.

    "summary": "In the first bucket, the focus is on achieving AI-level parallelism, creating a better pipeline, enabling the execution of different LLM tasks in parallel, and allowing future agents to add information to an execution graph. This parallelization is crucial for distributed systems processing and likely to advance the distribution and parallel running of models. The second bucket involves implementing transformations, such as converting unstructured transcripts into organized bullet point lists, and making this adaptable and viable through JSON. The goal is to seamlessly convert text into a GitHub issue, providing instructions for transformation and capturing context to refine models.",
    "text": "My previous recording didn't work, so here we are. Gonna simplify my thinking into two buckets, one being AI-level parallelism, basically wanting a better pipeline, and to be able to execute different LLM tasks in parallel, as well as being able to have agents in the future be able to add information to an execution graph. To be able to parallelize that, and that will be very important for distributed systems kind of processing, I believe. I think there's probably gonna be significant advances in how we distribute these models and can run them in parallel. So that seems like an important thing to be able to do from the software side, is getting infrastructure ready to be able to run things in parallel. Execute much faster, basically. And that could come down to hardware level or even network level. I think both need to be covered. The second bucket is transformations and wanting to add some kind of transformation to data on the webpage. For example, turning some unstructured transcript into a bullet point list. I think that makes a lot of sense, and that should be safe to JSON and all of these things, but that's more or less it. I may even want to take this text, for example, and turn it directly into a GitHub issue. As I'm thinking about this, and I really just want it to be like, okay, this thing right here, I know what it is. The agent actually doesn't even need to know what it is immediately. That would be a nice step, but I know it needs to be a GitHub issue, so I'd love to just be able to basically write, turn this into a GitHub issue. Turn bucket two into a GitHub issue, because I could read the transcript and figure out what needs to be done, and I could skim it and get that information. I'm actually not trying to solve the bigger problem yet, because that doesn't matter, and we can effectively capture that context and get the training data as a result of my actions and transformations that I want to make on the data. That gives the model a much better idea of what kinds of things I want to be doing on my data, and that can be used to fine-tune models, I believe."

    "text": "Following up on what I just sent, I find that I have many, many, many, many questions that basically rely on the same thing. And I think that if this problem can be solved, and there's good tooling around it, not only, well, A, an agent like Tanaki seems, like, much more friendly than just, like, a generic computer. If it's personal AI, you probably want some kind of personal thing to be interacting with. And if I take from Hinduism, and, like, Pasquale, you may not like this one in particular, but everyone has their own god, effectively, at least as I understand it. And in some way, that own god is, could be, like, spiritually similar to everyone has their own personal AI, effectively. And it may have those values and beliefs that you kind of embody and put into it. And it's like, Tanaki is Pasquale's personal AI, and also may go around to other people, and, you know, effectively, like, try to inspire them in those same ways to take on creativity and collaboration. But mine will probably be a bit different. So anyhow, this is some of the things that I'm thinking about. I am trying to think about it personally, from my point of view, what I would like to build, and how that fits into the overall narrative and pitch that we have already. Maybe it doesn't. Maybe it's a different pitch. Maybe it's a different angle to the same thing. But I would like very much to bring both into existence still. And I don't, I think they both are extremely important, and I don't really want to sacrifice on that. So this is something I don't, I don't know exactly what I'm saying yet. I'm just kind of working the problem out loud."

Like, what would it be like to be able to have a watch that just understands that I went surfing, or that I went climbing, or that I'm going to the gym. I guess one of the things in my world that's easy is place plays a massive role in those things. You know, if I've not explicitly told the computer, like, if I go to SWAMI's and then I'm not near my phone for an hour, likely the case is that I went surfing. One of the things that I'm curious about is, like, can all of that data be gathered like from the raw sensors and then inferred later on? It actually doesn't need to be inferred in real time. Real time would be great. So, yeah, something to think about. I definitely want to think about... Yeah, I don't know. Even something like driving, like GPS location and time gives you a lot of a sense of what is happening. And some of me is like, okay, well, my phone, when my phone is active, I only really need my GPS location to be recorded, like, you know, every five minutes, honestly, plenty. I mean, every minute would be fantastic. But even then, there's different granularities. So, so, even regardless of that, yeah, having my phone be able to infer context seems really important to me.

The writer anticipates challenges but expresses a hope to avoid negative consequences and eventually achieve success. Finally, the text concludes with a lighthearted remark and a reference to going to sleep.",
    "text": "What I just spoke about is effectively an aspiration. I was writing in my journal earlier about what communities do I want to be part of, and I guess that is one of the ones that I want to be part of. And being able to participate in that space as deeply as I can, I guess that's something that I'm very interested in at the moment, and I'm willing to push forward and potentially take a job doing that as well, because I think it's important. And I think building great tools for individuals and empowering individuals to play and explore their data and bring it back to themselves is something very much worth doing, because I think it's worth it for myself. I don't know what I am yet to discover, but I am sure I am going to discover something. And to aid in more people's discoveries, that excites me. It excites me in the same way that I'm excited to ask questions over my data, and even these things that I'm saying, it seems like with the power of the large language model and these little modules and plugins and making good ones for people by default, I just suspect that it's going to be really useful. And I could be entirely wrong, but I need to build the mini playground and try to make it happen and see what's possible from there. And I think that's kind of the guiding principle now, more or less, which is, well, start getting some of this recorded data in, see what we can switch off of OpenAI, see what models perform like what. And yeah, I mean, more or less, I think that's kind of the way. So yeah, I mean, we'll just take a run at it and kind of see how it goes. And as long as I can build tooling for myself to make it easy, you know, that's where we'll get to. But I think getting that web page up and literally just having a piece of data and some metadata in front of me and being able to work with it and being able to do some of that directly on the page, it doesn't even need to be saved to the file, being able to just work with it and manipulate it on the page, I suspect is going to be extremely useful. Again, how all of this is stored and logged and everything, I don't know yet. But I think that's more or less the direction for tomorrow is, well, really the rest of the week is just getting this onto a page and probably doing it from a third party application. I don't know yet. All I know is I'm probably going to hit the limit with BUN in terms of statically rendering things. So I want to move to a more reactive front end. And because of that, I will probably end up using Next.js and React to do that and a bunch of client components. I'll keep as much as I can on the server and keep it really simple. I'm going to keep it really, really simple and use BUN to run it, but that's going to be the goal. And yeah, just make a little tiny playground for myself. Probably a feed to begin with. I mean, we'll see. We'll see how much I can get away with. I don't know how this is going to work yet. I want to query it ideally all by natural language. So we will see what we can get out of it as a result of that. Don't know how much GPT this is going to need, or maybe I can just run something with JSON grammar and have it output me exactly what I want. But if we get there by the end of the week, that'll be a pretty satisfying end point. I think the pipeline is in good enough shape. We have pretty good audio going in. I think we need to make sure embeddings are making their way into the embedding space. But really, it's just going to be about getting the data in and then starting to play with it in one way or the other. That's going to be, yeah, I think playing with it is going to be the next step. Building. Building the playground. We have, we have the sand. Now let's build the playground. That's what needs to be done. Setting up the first set of monkey bars. And seeing how it is, it's probably going to be janky and rusty and crappy, but, you know, it'll be fun until it hurts someone. And we'll learn from that mistake and make it better. And, I guess, hopefully it doesn't hurt someone. That's the goal. Oh boy, here we go. Time to go to sleep."

    "summary": "The idea of having all data in one place can lead to an explosion of new applications, particularly with a focus on making it easy for developers to create and unleash an open ecosystem of creativity. The potential for building innovative and personalized social networks and niche communities is highlighted, with the vision of seamlessly integrating natural language and proactive notifications for enhanced social interactions. The broader implications of consolidating data suggest the potential for unlocking new social dynamics and facilitating DIY networks, adding a layer of depth to the reach and impact of social interactions. The emphasis on streamlining the process of creating and accessing these networks suggests a shift towards a more immersive and personally tailored online experience.",
    "text": "One of the DCs, maybe, is that with data in all one place, it potentially becomes very, very easy to build a lot of applications. And it's almost like the limit is your imagination. And I think that this is why maybe targeting DEVs and making it very easy to do that initially is really the right way to go, basically allowing the open ecosystem to find the killer app. But one of the things that I wonder is, with the right set of protocols in place, how quickly could I build an amazing dating app? I mean, partially it is relevant in my life to some degree. And also, how quick could you build new social networks with a different paradigm? DIY social network. How can you make it easy for anyone to build a social network? I certainly would love this for different communities in my life. Facebook groups solve something. But to have it more deeply integrated, not only if you could just build things with natural language for the social network, and if it had its own page, SoCal climbers, SoCal highliners. I mean, for me, that would be sick. I would absolutely love that. And beyond that, if I could basically get that feed to me when I think about the question of, what do I want to do this weekend? And given that, it might be able to read those feeds effectively and be like, there's a Highline gathering this weekend. Maybe you want to go to that. That would be great. Or even getting a notification proactively, like, hey, by the way, someone is hosting a Highline gathering this weekend, and I notice you don't have any weekend plans yet. Maybe that's what you want to do. So anyhow, these are very basic things. But I really do believe that putting data all in one place kind of unlocks a lot of potential for social interactions beyond the self-insight stuff that it could also kind of provide. But honestly, it's almost like the social and the DIY networks that are somehow much more interesting."

    "summary": "In essence, it seems to be an open source data platform aimed at connecting data through a protocol, making it desirable to other technology in the ecosystem. By serving as a foundation for top-level products, it is expected to stimulate innovation. The plan includes offering initial products with affordable pricing, aiming to integrate seamlessly into consumers' daily lives without being intrusive.",
    "text": "Just waking up. Basically, summing things down into, like, open source platform for data. Protocol to network data. This is obviously wanted by other pieces of technology in the ecosystem and by providing the foundational piece there can be a flourishing of these basically top-level products. And we are going to offer some as well. And the initial offerings will be things that do not cost a lot of money. That bring it down to the consumer and their everyday life in ways that probably are not very creepy. Thank you."

    "summary": "Chandler expressed interest in obtaining statistics about his life. The idea of having access to personal life stats also resonates with the speaker, who is intrigued by the concept. Both find the possibility of creating a tool to collect such data intriguing. The speaker shares Chandler's enthusiasm for life statistics and is interested in developing a way to gather them.",
    "text": "One thing that was interesting was that Chandler definitely mentioned wanting to get stats on his life, basically. And yeah, I mean, that'd be cool. I really like stats and I would love to be able to get those too. So building something that gets closer to that is also fascinating to me."
