Also, probably less people, because people don't like going when the tide is really high. It's going to make getting into the water pretty tricky, though."

    summary: "I've realized that I don't need immediate answers and having a progress update by Friday, such as a screenshot, will suffice to indicate we're on track. By Friday, if we haven't achieved this, we'll need to reassess our progress and consider whether we are closer to our goal. The possible expansion to different data sources is a concern, and I'm contemplating an 'agential' architecture where agents manage different types of data. To effectively answer questions with available data, we might use a system that assembles JSON objects, but how to handle various embedding spaces for different data types like audio or text remains uncertain.",
    text: "One thing that I just realized for myself is I don't need to have the answer to the question today. And if I could have the answer to the question by Friday, my original goal, that would be good enough. I don't need to have an MVP by Friday. I just want to have a screenshot by Friday. If I can have that, then I think we are moving towards something. If by Friday we do not have it, then that's a different issue. I guess at that point, we have to reevaluate based on where we're at. Are we any closer? Are we in the same place? And this is even before extending out data sources, which is something I'm mildly concerned about, how to make that really good and possible. I think given the framework and structure of what I have currently, it should be possible if we can answer the questions in this context, but it also may not be. And that is something that I'm going to have to think about and probably contend with in some way. And perhaps this is where I need to think about some agential type architecture where we kind of have agents for effectively kinds of data or something like that. I'm not sure. Where if you need to collect or collate some data, basically they are the ones containing the knowledge of the structures, something to that degree. Basically, how would you access those kind of pieces of information? And again, maybe the pipeline of assembling JSON objects is kind of the way that you do that, of like, okay, if I had this JSON object and I had that JSON object, I can answer this question effectively. Maybe that's a way of going about it. And maybe that's something to try in the sense like having an audio retriever and what data is embedded, what those embeddings mean, you know, blah, blah, blah. And maybe that's the same for, say, text messages or journals or whatever. Maybe those are in the same embedding spaces or maybe they're in different embedding spaces. That I'm not quite sure about yet. I suspect sometimes you'll want them to be in the same embedding space and I suspect other times you will not. So this is just like my first little attempt at thinking about this."

I'm considering using LangChain, but I'm also thinking about the agent's requirements, including tasks such as recursive summarization, which are well-suited for GPT-3 and could be more cost-effective with a local model. Additionally, I'm contemplating whether directly prompting the agent with instructions will be effective for its operation. On a different note, I observed a driver on the freeway driving at an excessively slow speed of 35 mph, which is concerning.",

Just something stupidly simple in JavaScript and seeing what happens because whatever currently is there I can use Microsoft's thing. I am hesitant to use LangChain but there's got to be something there and I think maybe I do need to enumerate more or less what I expect of the agent. What steps that it might want to do to get there and also what kinds of things generally need to happen like recursive summarization and that kind of thing. That is a very easy GPT-3 task and possibly even a local model which would save on compute significantly. And the other thing that I'm wondering is do I just fucking prompt it in an array to get my answer of I know exactly what it needs to do so I'm just going to tell it and it can figure it out.

    title: "\"AI for Friendship: Building Community and Creativity\"",
    summary: "AI for Friendship is gaining interest, fueling a creative desire to establish an environment akin to an art studio filled with engaging items. Dave proposed a concept, \"14 days of 13 bad posts,\" to clear out unproductive thoughts, highlighting the importance of community building as seen in Seth Godin's work and the importance of presentation. The tool in question has the potential to be profitable, with the expectation that successful users will share their strategies, thereby encouraging more effective use by others. An idea for a social game revolves around the concept of mutual discovery between participants, with the flexibility for users to engage with the system simply or contribute to its development.",
    text: "Reviewing some of the notes from my conversation with Kristen and Dave earlier, it sounds like AI for Friendship is resonating and that there's a creative scene wanting to emerge, which is super cool. And building something like an art studio with toys in it, all of this kind of thing, makes tons of sense. A lot of the relational stuff that we've been working on. One of the things that I really liked that Dave said, it was like 14 days of 13 bad posts. Just an idea he had and kind of want to try it because it sounds like a good way to flush some crappy thinking out in some way. But also, it's just interesting as a concept. And yeah, I guess that Dave also, I believe, pointing out some of the Seth Godin work with him building communities and how people want to be part of it and that kind of thing, as well as just like packaging is important. I'm learning that I want to lean into nerds. One of the things that I said that I think is important is that if this tool is successful, someone will make really good money off of it and that person will share how they did it and that will get other people using it effectively. And the final kind of thing that I'm really, really curious about is making a social game where success is really simple. This is something that Dave suggested and the thing that immediately came to mind was we are coming together because we want to discover something about someone else and ourselves. And that's kind of the container and maybe being able to share it at the end of whatever period of time it is. And I guess going along with that is playing with this system, trying to break it. You can show up and just use it and that's about all it takes. Or you could try to build something on top of it or contribute to the core code base or whatever it is."

    title: "\"Building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for Effective Data Querying and Accessibility\"",
    summary: "The primary goal is to establish a minimum viable product (MVP) that can effectively answer questions, albeit not necessarily all, and is accessible to a small group of users, including Chandler and myself. The MVP should include basic multimodal functionality, which is considered a critical element of the system. Another key aspect is the robustness of the deployment process, with the ideal scenario being an easy and cost-efficient method like one-click deployment, although initial manual setup may be acceptable. The final step is ensuring the MVP can effectively and powerfully query across different datasets, enhancing its utility as a tool for data exploration and thought.",
    text: "Okay, the thing that I'm thinking about most is what is MVP, effectively, and specifically meaning going to try to get 25 or 100 people or even spinning it up for Chandler and I. Basically using that as the metric of that's where we need to get to. I feel like there's really just a couple of things. One is like nailing the retrieval part and getting it at least to work for some questions. It doesn't have to work for every question, but if it can work for some, that'd be great. I also very much would like it to be very minimally multimodal. Basic multimodal capability seems very important. I don't know if that even is an MVP, but I would ideally like it to be. And then the next big thing is robustness, effectively being able to deploy this for other people and doing so in a way that's very easy and cheap, ideally, maybe even one-click deploy that someone could do or something else. And even if I have to do that initially, whatever, but there definitely needs to be like some level of that and onboarding to figure out. And I think that's going to be the last step because it doesn't make sense unless the other things work. We already know that we can query across people. It's like no issue. That's totally viable and doable. The problem is making those queries really, really effective. So if we can make queries effective and ideally have more data sources to make it even more robust and powerful and interesting, that would be fantastic. I personally want it just for like minimal viable data and exploration and making that easy for someone else to do. Again, tools for thought."

    "title": "\"AI for Friendship: Building Community and Creativity\"",
    "summary": "AI for Friendship is gaining interest, fueling a creative desire to establish an environment akin to an art studio filled with engaging items. Dave proposed a concept, \"14 days of 13 bad posts,\" to clear out unproductive thoughts, highlighting the importance of community building as seen in Seth Godin's work and the importance of presentation. The tool in question has the potential to be profitable, with the expectation that successful users will share their strategies, thereby encouraging more effective use by others. An idea for a social game revolves around the concept of mutual discovery between participants, with the flexibility for users to engage with the system simply or contribute to its development.",
    "text": "Reviewing some of the notes from my conversation with Kristen and Dave earlier, it sounds like AI for Friendship is resonating and that there's a creative scene wanting to emerge, which is super cool. And building something like an art studio with toys in it, all of this kind of thing, makes tons of sense. A lot of the relational stuff that we've been working on. One of the things that I really liked that Dave said, it was like 14 days of 13 bad posts. Just an idea he had and kind of want to try it because it sounds like a good way to flush some crappy thinking out in some way. But also, it's just interesting as a concept. And yeah, I guess that Dave also, I believe, pointing out some of the Seth Godin work with him building communities and how people want to be part of it and that kind of thing, as well as just like packaging is important. I'm learning that I want to lean into nerds. One of the things that I said that I think is important is that if this tool is successful, someone will make really good money off of it and that person will share how they did it and that will get other people using it effectively. And the final kind of thing that I'm really, really curious about is making a social game where success is really simple. This is something that Dave suggested and the thing that immediately came to mind was we are coming together because we want to discover something about someone else and ourselves. And that's kind of the container and maybe being able to share it at the end of whatever period of time it is. And I guess going along with that is playing with this system, trying to break it. You can show up and just use it and that's about all it takes. Or you could try to build something on top of it or contribute to the core code base or whatever it is."

    "title": "\"Building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for Effective Data Querying and Accessibility\"",
    "summary": "The primary goal is to establish a minimum viable product (MVP) that can effectively answer questions, albeit not necessarily all, and is accessible to a small group of users, including Chandler and myself. The MVP should include basic multimodal functionality, which is considered a critical element of the system. Another key aspect is the robustness of the deployment process, with the ideal scenario being an easy and cost-efficient method like one-click deployment, although initial manual setup may be acceptable. The final step is ensuring the MVP can effectively and powerfully query across different datasets, enhancing its utility as a tool for data exploration and thought.",
    "text": "Okay, the thing that I'm thinking about most is what is MVP, effectively, and specifically meaning going to try to get 25 or 100 people or even spinning it up for Chandler and I. Basically using that as the metric of that's where we need to get to. I feel like there's really just a couple of things. One is like nailing the retrieval part and getting it at least to work for some questions. It doesn't have to work for every question, but if it can work for some, that'd be great. I also very much would like it to be very minimally multimodal. Basic multimodal capability seems very important. I don't know if that even is an MVP, but I would ideally like it to be. And then the next big thing is robustness, effectively being able to deploy this for other people and doing so in a way that's very easy and cheap, ideally, maybe even one-click deploy that someone could do or something else. And even if I have to do that initially, whatever, but there definitely needs to be like some level of that and onboarding to figure out. And I think that's going to be the last step because it doesn't make sense unless the other things work. We already know that we can query across people. It's like no issue. That's totally viable and doable. The problem is making those queries really, really effective. So if we can make queries effective and ideally have more data sources to make it even more robust and powerful and interesting, that would be fantastic. I personally want it just for like minimal viable data and exploration and making that easy for someone else to do. Again, tools for thought."

MY COMPLETION WAS:
 To retrieve the latest 10 posts that are older than the hash `7bc043bc0c7d87138856b4308215f014c5b45bef748f01b39e59b52184f25899`, we need to compare the given hash with the hashes in the dataset. Since SHA-256 hashes are not directly comparable in terms of time, we will assume "older" refers to the order in which the hashes are listed in the data array above.

However, based on the information provided, it appears there is no reference hash `7bc043bc0c7d87138856b4308215f014c5b45bef748f01b39e59b52184f25899`, in the data given. Given that we cannot determine which posts are "older", I cannot filter them based on that criteria.

If these hashes represented a commit history or another sequentially based system, we would find the provided hash and list the hashes that came before it. Hypothetically, if the hash in question were the hash of the latest item in your data (the one with the `created` time `1704902588`), then the 10 posts "older" than it would be the earlier entries. But without further context or a timestamp or sequence number comparison, such assumptions may not be correct.

If you're looking for the latest ten posts from the data provided regardless of the reference hash, they would be the ones with the created timestamps from `1704813770` to `1704902588`. Here is how they would be extracted in the requested format:

By Friday, if we haven't achieved this, we'll need to reassess our progress and consider whether we are closer to our goal. The possible expansion to different data sources is a concern, and I'm contemplating an 'agential' architecture where agents manage different types of data. To effectively answer questions with available data, we might use a system that assembles JSON objects, but how to handle various embedding spaces for different data types like audio or text remains uncertain."

    "summary": "I need to create a simple JavaScript agent, possibly inspired by Simon Willison's blog, to see how it performs compared to existing solutions like Microsoft's. I'm considering using LangChain, but I'm also thinking about the agent's requirements, including tasks such as recursive summarization, which are well-suited for GPT-3 and could be more cost-effective with a local model. Additionally, I'm contemplating whether directly prompting the agent with instructions will be effective for its operation. On a different note, I observed a driver on the freeway driving at an excessively slow speed of 35 mph, which is concerning."
