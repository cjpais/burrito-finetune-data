What an incredible lesson to learn to just go talk to someone. And it's so much easier to talk to someone who knows what you're talking about and can at least offer something like being dumber. Being dumber is amazing. I love being dumber because the other person can just say something that makes so much more sense. And as a result, I can learn from that. And I learned through experience by bashing my head into a fucking wall for like days. And what did I learn out of that experience? I learned two great things that I should talk to people. Well, really, actually, it's just that that I should talk to people and I guess be around more of those people if possible."

And how do we begin to process large amounts of data to put it in the right format? How do we connect data sources to each other? Those are all open and important questions to form an overall better context of who we are. And I would love to say just like shoving all the documents into RAG and pulling out the top five is going to work. But like, I just don't know how that's going to fucking work. It's just not enough context about someone. I can't fit my context in five documents unless those documents are perfect documents.

    title: "\"Optimizing Data Transformation with GPT-4\"",
    summary: "The individual has discovered that working backward from a desired result with a large language model is surprisingly effective, especially when detailing the problem forward seems challenging. This backward approach has simplified the problem and resulted in the use of GPT-4 for data transformation within the context window, improving the process. An automatic metadata generation pipeline is emerging, where data transformations are added as needed, potentially storing transformations for future use based on query relevance. This system will generate an extensive amount of synthetic data, allowing for the extraction of relevant information through queries fed into the model at later stages, rather than having to pre-determine all questions.",
    text: "It's funny, with the large language model stuff, working backwards from the answer that I want has seemed to help more than trying to work forward from the large language model, which is very interesting in terms of how it reasons, where, like, I'm working backwards through a problem and it has to, like, write things down on a piece of paper before it continues, which is really fascinating to think about the differences, like, it's hard for me to work this problem forwards, actually. I mean, like, I can just intuit about it forwards, but to then describe it effectively to a large language model, I'm working it backwards. Interesting. But I think, I mean, made decent progress at the very least. I think the problem has been simplified by working backwards in this way. So the last step of the pipeline is just, like, do a data transformation, more or less. And initially I was using, like, a small stupid model to do that, and instead it's just like, okay, we're just going to use GPT-4 and shove everything in the context window under a certain size and do that, and that'll be good enough. And indeed that's what we're going to do. So given that, like, it's helping me start to figure out some aspect of training data as well, like what data I will need to train. And then also it is effectively generating tons of synthetic pairs. So I will want to generate individual synthetic pairs as well. This is something that I'm thinking about after this next step gets done effectively. After this step is done, well, then we can go and basically what we'll want to do is remove whatever transform we're doing. So if we've transformed some data, we're going to want to go back to the metadata field, look at the unstructured data, and just immediately run that transformation on that piece of data. And if there is nothing to be transformed, we'll just output null, and nothing will go back into the metadata file. But this is effectively going to be automatically adding steps to the pipeline. That's kind of what's happening here. You ask it a question, and it's going to go and just add that data to the pipeline. Initially, none of that data is going to be used probably, but in the future, what would be great is to effectively cache those transformations and have a description of what the transformations that you have are on any piece of data. And if that transformation matches up with the user's query in any reasonable way, and again, maybe this is using embeddings or something, or maybe just a large language model that's tuned to it, it goes and does that. But this is going to be effectively like an automatic metadata generation system that will hopefully continuously improve. And we're just going to generate a massive amount of synthetic data over whatever data we put in. And I don't need to come up with all of the questions for the data in advance, because I can go and ask those questions later to get the relevant data I want out of it. And that is going to be kind of what we are really doing initially."

    title: "\"Advancing Hardware Performance: The Nexus of Software and Hardware Convergence\"",
    summary: "NVIDIA has historically excelled in developing software tailored to its hardware, which has been pivotal to its success and influence in the AI industry, much of which can be attributed to its proprietary CUDA technology. The importance of software in enhancing hardware capabilities is highlighted, prompting a reflection on the potential of working with open-source libraries like llama.cpp to further accelerate hardware performance. The writer expresses a willingness to operate at the intersection of software and hardware, an area they find intriguing, especially with tasks like memory management and massively parallel processing on machine learning inference cards. This convergence of software and hardware is not only a subject of professional interest for the author but also recognized as an area of important technological development.",
    text: "It's interesting that NVIDIA's trend throughout its history has been making very excellent software for its hardware, as in initially bringing drivers in house, according to Asianometry. And how, I mean, if we look forward to today, how them being able to focus on software for their hardware has enabled them to be as big of a company as they are, and to be a force in the AI industry is only because of their drivers. At the end of the day, it's because of CUDA. So it's interesting to see how important software is for hardware. And yeah, I mean, it just makes me think maybe I need to look at llama.cpp and all of these open source libraries to accelerate hardware, as well as maybe there's some frameworks that still need help. And what ways can we accelerate them? Because I don't mind being on the boundary of software and hardware. I worked on that boundary already, effectively firmware, or right above firmware, and I can be comfortable in that place. And managing memory and all of that is, it's an interesting thing. And to work on something massively parallel, like a machine learning inference card, would be fascinating and also quite important, I think. So that's a fun little tangent, I guess, of possibilities."

    "text": "It's funny, with the large language model stuff, working backwards from the answer that I want has seemed to help more than trying to work forward from the large language model, which is very interesting in terms of how it reasons, where, like, I'm working backwards through a problem and it has to, like, write things down on a piece of paper before it continues, which is really fascinating to think about the differences, like, it's hard for me to work this problem forwards, actually. I mean, like, I can just intuit about it forwards, but to then describe it effectively to a large language model, I'm working it backwards. Interesting. But I think, I mean, made decent progress at the very least. I think the problem has been simplified by working backwards in this way. So the last step of the pipeline is just, like, do a data transformation, more or less. And initially I was using, like, a small stupid model to do that, and instead it's just like, okay, we're just going to use GPT-4 and shove everything in the context window under a certain size and do that, and that'll be good enough. And indeed that's what we're going to do. So given that, like, it's helping me start to figure out some aspect of training data as well, like what data I will need to train. And then also it is effectively generating tons of synthetic pairs. So I will want to generate individual synthetic pairs as well. This is something that I'm thinking about after this next step gets done effectively. After this step is done, well, then we can go and basically what we'll want to do is remove whatever transform we're doing. So if we've transformed some data, we're going to want to go back to the metadata field, look at the unstructured data, and just immediately run that transformation on that piece of data. And if there is nothing to be transformed, we'll just output null, and nothing will go back into the metadata file. But this is effectively going to be automatically adding steps to the pipeline. That's kind of what's happening here. You ask it a question, and it's going to go and just add that data to the pipeline. Initially, none of that data is going to be used probably, but in the future, what would be great is to effectively cache those transformations and have a description of what the transformations that you have are on any piece of data. And if that transformation matches up with the user's query in any reasonable way, and again, maybe this is using embeddings or something, or maybe just a large language model that's tuned to it, it goes and does that. But this is going to be effectively like an automatic metadata generation system that will hopefully continuously improve. And we're just going to generate a massive amount of synthetic data over whatever data we put in. And I don't need to come up with all of the questions for the data in advance, because I can go and ask those questions later to get the relevant data I want out of it. And that is going to be kind of what we are really doing initially."

    "title": "\"Advancing Hardware Performance: The Nexus of Software and Hardware Convergence\"",
    "summary": "NVIDIA has historically excelled in developing software tailored to its hardware, which has been pivotal to its success and influence in the AI industry, much of which can be attributed to its proprietary CUDA technology. The importance of software in enhancing hardware capabilities is highlighted, prompting a reflection on the potential of working with open-source libraries like llama.cpp to further accelerate hardware performance. The writer expresses a willingness to operate at the intersection of software and hardware, an area they find intriguing, especially with tasks like memory management and massively parallel processing on machine learning inference cards. This convergence of software and hardware is not only a subject of professional interest for the author but also recognized as an area of important technological development.",
    "text": "It's interesting that NVIDIA's trend throughout its history has been making very excellent software for its hardware, as in initially bringing drivers in house, according to Asianometry. And how, I mean, if we look forward to today, how them being able to focus on software for their hardware has enabled them to be as big of a company as they are, and to be a force in the AI industry is only because of their drivers. At the end of the day, it's because of CUDA. So it's interesting to see how important software is for hardware. And yeah, I mean, it just makes me think maybe I need to look at llama.cpp and all of these open source libraries to accelerate hardware, as well as maybe there's some frameworks that still need help. And what ways can we accelerate them? Because I don't mind being on the boundary of software and hardware. I worked on that boundary already, effectively firmware, or right above firmware, and I can be comfortable in that place. And managing memory and all of that is, it's an interesting thing. And to work on something massively parallel, like a machine learning inference card, would be fascinating and also quite important, I think. So that's a fun little tangent, I guess, of possibilities."

And one guy brought out a shortboard, which is probably the funniest thing that I've seen in a bit, for waves like that. I was like, dude, I don't even have a long enough board. So, it was funny. But, I mean, it was alright. Got a couple good ones. It was mostly just kind of swampy, swampy surf."
